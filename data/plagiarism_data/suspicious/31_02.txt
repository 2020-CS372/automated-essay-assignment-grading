Figure 8.  The measurement architecture of the time synchronization
     Figure 6 Layer diagram for Preemptive Priority Mechanism  When a time synchronization frame reaches the  Preemptive Queue with a sending time t, it firstly be queued,  and then the preemptive priority mechanism will interrupt  the sending of other frames when the actual time is t.  After  the time synchronization frame is sent, the frame which is  interrupted will continue to be transmitted.   IV. EXPERIMENT  To verify the performance of the proposed scheme, we  developed a customized switch and test nodes with time  client based on the ADSP-BF518 processor from ADI. The  processor has a built-in Ethernet media-access controller  (EMAC) module, and it can detect and provide hardware  time stamps for all pre-defined event messages, including  both incoming and outgoing packets by its TSYNC module  which keeps monitoring the hardware interface between the  MAC controller and the Ethernet physical interface  transceiver, that is, the media independent interface (MII).   The detection of event messages is designed to be  programmable.  A complete proposed time synchronization  implementation was built on ADSP-BF518 processor as  shown in Figure 7.    Figure 7 Implementation of Time Synchronization Based on ADSP-BF518  The TSYNC module of the processor detects incoming  and outgoing time synchronization messages and use  hardware to time-stamp event messages and uses the MAC  controller driver to implement the preemptive priority queue.   The Ethernet PHY is National Semiconductor DP83848,  chosen because of its low jitter delay characteristics.  For  simplicity, the processorâ€™s system clock (80 MHz) was  chosen to be the TSYNC module clock source.          The measurements were made as illustrated in Figure 8.  The two clocks were connected directly via class 5 cable.   Each clock has a 1-PPS test point.  An oscilloscope(TDC- GP2) was used to measure the relative offsets between the  master and the slave.     Figure 8.  The measurement architecture of the time synchronization       Because the switch and the node with time client operate  at 80MHz, it offers a 12. 5ns sampling granularity.  It means  incoming and outgoing frame at the master and slave  introduce a 12. 5ns uncertainty or jitter.
