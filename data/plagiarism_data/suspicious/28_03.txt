Fig.7 Flow Chart For Distance Measurement
 In each of these sets, there are 10 face images as shown in Table 1.  Each of them varies in orientation and expression.  Table 1. Face Database Structure Training Set Test Set Face Image 40 face images (10 subjects x 4) 40 face images (10 subjects x 4) Size of each image 720 x 576 = 414720 pixels 720 x 576 = 414720 pixels Resized Image 30 x 30 = 900 pixels 30 x 30 = 900 pixels The original images are 720 by 576 pixels in dimension, which means each has a total pixel size of 414720.  This size is not efficient for normal training, especially when large training sets are available.  To avoid increased computation and long training times, it is necessary to resize the face images.  The images are therefore resized to 30Ã—30 pixels immediately after they have passed through the hit and miss kernels, before entering the classification stage.  C. Obstacle Detection and Path Planning Module For mobile robots, functions, which recognize environments, are required to find unpredictable obstacles and paths through which the robot can pass [4].  As for range sensors, which can measure a distance to objects, ultrasonic sensor (Fig.7) is more commonly used with mobile robots because it is small, inexpensive and easy to calculate distances.  Fig.6 Principle Of Operation Of Ultrasonic Sensor Ultrasonic waves are discharged from a transmitter given comparatively long burst waves in order to vibrate its piezoelectric vibrator fully.  A range value is calculated by using the amplified echo and a threshold level.  Fig.7 Flow Chart For Distance Measurement The distance between the Soft-i-Robot and the obstacle in the workspace is measured using the ultrasonic sensor according to the flow chart shown in  Figure 8. This distance measured from the ultrasonic sensor is the actual distance. Inorder to optimize the path and distance of the robot Evolutionary Algorithm such as the Genetic Algorithm is used.  Variable-length chromosomes have been employed.  Their elements represent nodes included in a path between a designated pair of source and destination nodes.
