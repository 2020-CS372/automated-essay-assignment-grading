 Examples of injection vulnerabilities are:   - SQL injection: the input contains SQL code that is  erroneously executed in the database backend;  - command injection: the input contains OS  commands that are erroneously executed via the  operating system;  - cross-site scripting: the input contains Java-script  code that is erroneously executed by a victim’s  browser.   Security assessments of web components of current  cloud offerings show the prevalence of injection  vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art offerings.  • Weak authentication schemes.  Many widely used  authentication mechanisms are weak.  For example, the  use of usernames and passwords for authentication is  weak because of (1) insecure user behavior (users tend to  use weak passwords, re-use passwords, etc.) and (2)  inherent limitations of one-factor authentication  mechanisms.  The implementation of authentication  mechanisms may also have weaknesses allowing, for  example, the interception and replay of credentials [8].   The majority of current web applications used in state-of- the-art cloud services employ usernames and passwords  as authentication mechanism.    IX. SECURITY RISK ANALYSIS IN THE CLOUD SYSTEMS  There are many risk assessment methodologies, but in  all of these methodologies, similar steps are carried out.   Fig. 2 shows the steps of NIST’s risk assessment  methodology as described in “NIST SP 800-30: Risk  Management Guide for Information Technology  Systems” [6]. Figure 2. Assessment Activities according to NIST SP800-30  Step 2: Threat  Identification   Step 3: Vulnerability  Identification  Step 4: Control  Analysis   Step 5: Likelihood  Determination    Step 6: Impact  Analysis    Step 7: Risk  Determination    Step 8: Control  Recommendations    Step 1: System  Characterization 741  ISO 27005 [9] defines risk as “the potential that a  given threat will exploit vulnerabilities of an asset or  group of assets and thereby cause harm to the  organization” and adds that it is measured in terms of a  combination of the likelihood of an event and its  consequences. A useful overview of factors contributing  to risk [10],[11] is presented in Fig. 3.                                                                 Figure 3.  Factors contributing to security risk  There are identified around 40 cloud-specific  vulnerabilities (nine of which are control challenges) and  each vulnerability has been positioned in relevant layer(s)  and supporting function(s) of the cloud reference  architecture. Thus, a cloud-specific risk assessment  following, e.g., the steps outlined in  Figure 2 is supported  as follows:  • System Characterization. By positioning relevant  system components in the cloud reference architecture,  a standardized abstract view on a system under  evaluation can be achieved.   • Vulnerability Identification.  Because all identified  cloud-specific vulnerabilities have also been positioned  in the cloud reference architecture, it is immediately  clear, which vulnerabilities are relevant for the system  under consideration (and which system components  may be affected).  Thus, the usually time-consuming  process of vulnerability identification can be carried  out very efficiently.   • Control Analysis & Control Recommendations.  The  mapping of vulnerabilities into controls provides a  sound basis for control analysis and control  recommendations.

The  mapping of vulnerabilities into controls provides a  sound basis for control analysis and control  recommendations.    There are 6 main factors, which make influence on  the vulnerability: the point of vulnerability appearance,  the level of security, the value of the processed  information, the influence of cloud-specifics, the  adequateness of security tools applying, the qualification  of safety administrator.   Let's enter the concept of the vulnerability of types I  and II. The type I are such vulnerability which are  potentially prevented by the security tools implemented  in cloud systems, and the type II are those, which are not  prevented even potentially.  We generate an integral  estimation C, determined the potential damage due to the  to attack on  the vulnerability:  Primary  Loss  Factors Secondary  Loss   Factors  Asset  Loss Threat  Loss  Organi- zational External Value Volume Probable  Loss  Magnitude Loss  Event  Risk  Threat  Event  Frequency  Vulnera -bility  Action  Contact  Threat  Capability  Control  Strength  Timing  Compe-  tence  Action Internal vs External  Due  Diligence Response Detection Productivity  Sensitivity  Cost  Access  Misuse  Disclose  Modify  Deny Access  Containment  Remediation  Recovery  Embarrassment  Competitive Adv.
