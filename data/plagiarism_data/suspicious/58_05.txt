Figure 10. Machine-level FSM withbroken tool detection
 A broken tool detection algorithm is then developed and  integrated into the motion controller to evaluate the reconfigurability of the software.  A broken tool detection algorithm         is developed separately and implemented as an individual component.  The function of the broken tool detection component is to detect abnormal forces at runtime, and send   a stop signal to the motion controller when such a force is observed.  The software structure with  the broken tool detection algorithm is shown in Figure 9.  Figure 7. Behavior specifications of Tobotool motion controller.

To react to the new signal from the broken tool detection algorithm, the machine-level control logic needs to be changed, while the rest of behaviors remain the same.  Figure 10 shows the new machine-level FSM.  Figure 10. Machine-level FSM with broken tool detection  5.2. Reconfigurable Machine Tool Controller # We then modified the Mobile motion control software to construct another motion control software for a reconfigurable Machine Tool (RMT).  RMT is a modularized and composable machine tool with 2-axis and  a 2-position discrete device.  Unlike the Mobile, the RMT motion controller needs neither coordinated motion nor  monitoring.  The same axes and translator components are used to con-struct the RMT motion controller.  A new component, Spindle, is added into the system to control the discrete device.  The software structure for RMT controller is illustrated in Figure 11. The behavior specifications for Axis components are the same as those used for the Mobile.
