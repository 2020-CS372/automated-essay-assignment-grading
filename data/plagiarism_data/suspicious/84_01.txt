fig 2. Average diameter of the iris is 12 mm, and  the pupil size can vary from 10% to 80% of the iris  diameter [8]. The biometric sample is then transformed  using some sort of mathematical function into a biometric  template. It will provide a normalized, efficient and  representation of the feature, which can then be  objectively compared with other templates in order to  determine identity.      II. IRIS RECOGNITION SYSTEM  The iris is the colored portion of the eye that  surrounds the pupil as shown in figure 1. An iris  recognition system is composed of many stages as firstly,  an image of the person's eye is captured and preprocessed.   Secondly, the image is localized to determine the iris  boundaries.  Thirdly, the iris boundary coordinates are  converted to the stretched polar coordinates to normalize  the scale and illumination of the iris in the image.   Fourthly, features representing the iris patterns are  extracted based on the analysis.  Then the code is  generated.  After that, the person is identified by  comparing his/her code with an iris database.  These  processes are named as Image acquisition, Segmentation,  Normalization, Feature extraction, Code generation as  shown in fig 3.    Fig.3 Iris Recognition System    Segmentation    The first stage of iris recognition is to isolate the  actual iris region in a digital eye image.  The success of  segmentation depends on the imaging quality of eye  images.  Images in the CASIA iris database [10] do not  contain specular reflections due to the use of near infra- red light for illumination.  The segmentation is achieved  by Canny Edge Detection is a multi-step edge detection  procedure by Canny as follows  Image  acquisition  Segmentation  Normalization -3. 14 -0.23i  -3.68 -0. 27i  Code  generation  00 00 10 11 11 01  Feature extractionICICES2014 - S.A.Engineering College, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India    ISBN No. 978-1-4799-3834-6/14/$31.
