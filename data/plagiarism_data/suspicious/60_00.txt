 Implementation methodology and results are presented in section IV and Secton V respectively.  Section VI providesthe conclusion of this work.  II. QRD-RLS ALGORITHM A. QR Decomposition QR Decomposition is an elementary operation which decom- poses a matrix into an orthogonal and a triangular matrix [7].  QR decomposition of a real square matrix U is as U = Q×R, where Q is an orthogonal matrix (Q T Q = I) and R is an upper triangular matrix.  B. Givens Rotations Givens Rotation is used to ﬁnd an operator which rotates each vector through a ﬁxed angle and this operator can be represented as a matrix [7].  Givens method is useful when adaptive algorithms like RLS are considered because in order to obtain the triangular form, the entries in the matrix are zeroed in a particular manner.  This leads to a simple implementation which combined with its numerical stability results in an efﬁcient algorithm.  C. QR decomposition based RLS Fig. 1 shows QR decomposition based RLS algorithm.  The least squares approach attempts to ﬁnd the set of coefﬁcients w n that minimizes the sum of squares of error.  Equation (1) refers to the least square solution, Uw = d+ e (1) where U is an input matrix (m × n with m>n), d is a known desired sequence and w is the coefﬁcients vector to be computed such that the error vector e is minimized.  Direct computation of coefﬁcient vector w involves matrix inversion, which is undesirable for hardware implementations.  QR decomposition based least square methods avoid such explicit matrix inversions and are more robust for hardware implementation.  Fig. 1. QR Decomposition based RLS The QRD is used to solve the least square problem as follows.  Equation (2) shows the QR decomposition of the compound matrix [U|d]as, [U d]= [Q q] .  R z 0 ς  (2) where [Q|q] is orthogonal and  R z 0 ς  is triangular matrix and z = Q T d.
