Figure 7 Implementation of Time Synchronization Based on ADSP-BF518 
 After the  time  synchronization  frame  is  sent,  the  frame  which  is 
interrupted will continue to be transmitted. 
IV.    EXPERIMENT 
To  verify  the  performance  of  the  proposed  scheme,  we 
developed  a  customized  switch  and  test  nodes  with  time 
client based on the ADSP-BF518 processor from ADI. The 
processor  has  a  built-in  Ethernet  media-access  controller 
(EMAC)  module,  and  it  can  detect  and  provide  hardware 
time  stamps  for  all  pre-defined  event  messages,  including 
both incoming and outgoing packets by its TSYNC module 
which keeps monitoring the hardware interface between the 
MAC   controller   and   the   Ethernet   physical   interface 
transceiver,  that  is,  the  media  independent  interface  (MII). 
The   detection   of   event   messages   is   designed   to   be 
programmable.A  complete  proposed  time  synchronization implementation  was  built  on  ADSP-BF518  processor  as 
shown in Figure 7. The  TSYNC  module  of  the  processor  detects  incoming 
and   outgoing   time   synchronization   messages   and   use 
hardware  to time-stamp  event  messages  and  uses  the  MAC 
controller driver to implement the preemptive priority queue. 
The  Ethernet  PHY  is  National  Semiconductor  DP83848, 
chosen  because  of  its  low  jitter  delay  characteristics.  For 
simplicity,  the  processor’s  system  clock  (80  MHz)  was 
chosen to be the TSYNC module clock source.
