Figure 1. The flowchart of the sanitization process
 In the  following, the basic concept of our approach is  discussed.   In order to fit the properties of the binary matrix  which is the representation of the transactional  database, some different definitions of the matrix  multiplication are given as follows:  1.  If D ij =0, D' ij  is set to 0 directly.  This is because  our goal is to hide sensitive patterns by decreasing  their supports, therefore, we only need to take care of  how and when an entry with its value equal to 1 in D  should be converted to 0 in D'.  Moreover, it also  guarantees that there are no new artificial patterns  created by the sanitization process.   2. If the resulting value of  ∑ = ⋅ m k kj ik S D 1 is not  smaller than 1, set D' ij  to 1.   3. If the resulting value of ∑ = ⋅ m k kj ik S D 1 is not larger  than 0, set D' ij  to 0. Fig. 1 shows the flowchart of our approach. There  are several components in the sanitization process.   Each of them will be discussed in this section.     Figure 1. The flowchart of the sanitization process    3. 1. Sanitization matrix setting  As discussed in section 1, to avoid Forward- Inference Attack, for each sensitive pattern P in P H , at  least one pattern belong to the pair-subset of P should  be hidden or the attackers can infer from the subset  with length 2 to the sensitive pattern recursively.  The  pair-subset is defined as follows:  Definition 1: Let F be a frequent pattern.  The pair- subpattern of F is a sub-pattern of F with length 2.  The  set which includes all pair-subpatterns of F is called  the pair-subset of F.  In our approach, a temporary set, Marked-Set, is  used to store the victim pair-subpatterns.
