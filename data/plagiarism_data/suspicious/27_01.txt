 The resulting weights of the  elements may be called the local weights.        Step 3: Local weights and consistency of comparisons.       Here, local weights of the elements are calculated from  the judgment matrices using the eigenvector method  (EVM).      Step 4: Aggregation of weights across various levels to  obtain the final weights of alternatives.     151In this final step, the local weights of elements of  different levels are aggregated to obtain final weights of the  decision alternatives (elements at the lowest level).     B. AHP Analysis    AHP analysis was done with Web-HIPRE. It is a  multicriteria decision support system which provides a set of  analytical methods such as SMART, SMARTER, as well as  AHP. In addition to various decision analysis methods,  another benefit of Web-HIPRE is its freely available online  which allows the use of this program more widely.   Furthermore, it also supports AHP group decision analysis to  gain aggregate of several decision makers into single  decision [12].  Figure 2 shows our evaluation model  developed in Web-HIPRE.

If CR values are > 0. 10 for a matrix larger than 4x4, it  indicates an inconsistent judgment as mentioned by Saaty  [9].  It is sometimes difficult and time consuming tasks to ask  decision makers repeat the survey.  However, this should be  done in order to keep the level of inconsistency measure at  acceptable limit and to justify the final results.   Based on survey, we fulfilled paired comparison matrix  online.  At this stage, we created five comparison matrices  which represent decision maker opinion of recent  information security policy implementations according to the  evaluation model.
