For the ideal case, a similar  procedure can be used for the integer space if we use  N instead of T where N is the number of unique  symbols in a constellation (e.g., 4 for QPSK or 16 for  16QAM).

Random bits are produced by  a Random Sequencer, then, become modulated signal  with the frequency of 5GHz after passing through a  Modulator Baseband.  This Modulator Baseband is  made up of Modulator Baseband and Frequency  Up-Converter.  The signal from the Modulator  Baseband is complex signal b which is also the  important ideal input signal for EVM calculation.   Then, the modulated signal will pass through wireless  channels with different distortion.  Finally, we will  receive the baseband signal at the receiving terminal  from a Demodulator Baseband which is also consisted  of Demodulator Baseband and Frequency  Down-Converter.  The complex signal c is also the important  measured input signal for EVM calculation, and  obviously has some error compare with signal b.  The  module of EVM calculation is based on the expression  (9), b and c are inputs, and output is from the EVM of  wireless system.
