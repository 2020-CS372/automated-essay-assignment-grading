 It is particularly appropriate for  tbe design and implementation of controllers for linear  open-loop stable system [2,3].  The IMC controller design  is theoretically well explored for linear processes.  In  practice, however, almost evely process displays nonlinear  behavior especially if it is driven in a wide operating  range.  Hence, the need emerges to extend the linear design  procedure to nonlinear systems [3].  Development of a  Iran University OF Science and Technology  Tehran, IRAN  {rabmati, f.rashidi@iust.ac.ir)  nonlinear extension of the IMC scheme presents serious  difficulties duo to the inherent complexity of nonlinear  systems.  In spite of potential for closed-loop performance  improvement, nonlinear control strategies should be  applied with some caution duo to commensurate increase  in computational load.   Neural networks as well as fuzzy systems have been  widely employed for the representation of nonlinear  systems and the idea of intemal model control can he  combined with these types of models [5,14].  In ibis paper,  a LOLIMOT model will be used [7,8,12,13], see figure 1.  Here, the output of the model is calculated as an  interpolation of locally valid linear models.  Local model  architectures have several advantages over conventional  black-box approaches.  On the one hand, their transpareut  architecture allows the combination of prior knowledge  about the process with measured identification data.  On  the other hand, classical linear control design methods can  be utilized for nonlinear controller design.  For the IMC  approach, this local linearity can be exploited directly and  a nonlinear gain-scheduled coutroller can he obtained.   It can be shown that for simple linear models, the IMC  loop can be transferred to classical feedback structures  resulting in e.g.  PI or PID controllers [10,11].
