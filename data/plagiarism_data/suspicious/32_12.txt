 5) Agent interactions modeling: deﬁnition of the interactions between different agents.  6) Agent behavior functions: design of the software func- tions to allow the agent interactions, including the con- trol mechanisms which allow autonomy, reactiveness, and pro-activeness.  Stages 1 and 2 were undertaken in collaboration with UHF monitoring experts and utility representatives.  Based on these discussions and knowledge capture, the task hierarchy shown in Fig. 1 was developed.  Stage 3 required the design of an ontology for COMMAS. This is one of the key aspects of a MAS as it underpins the inter-agent communication.  It also becomes the basis for exten- sibility.  The ontology is the system vocabulary, and it is within the ontology that concepts and their relationships are deﬁned [11].  As an example, the basic ontology for the transformer mon- itoring system is shown in Fig. 2. It should be viewed as a class hierarchy of facts.  For example, a TxUHFFeatureVector fact will inherit the attributes of the TransformerData fact.  This also ensures that a valid TxUHFFeatureVector must be associ- ated with a valid transformer.  Therefore, data integrity is en- sured.  It is assumed that an implementation of COMMAS will operate per substation.  As a result, the substation information only needs to be attached when communicating to other higher level systems.  The COMMAS fact is used to aggregate all the information for such interactions.
