Fig. 5: Activity Diagram of the Product Order Use Case
  Negotiate: when this use case is executed, a negotiation  takes place between the customer actor and the transport  firm actor about the terms of the payment (e.g. method of  payment) and the physical delivery of the products.   Transport order: after a successful matching and  negotiation process, the transport firm actor is responsible  to transport the order according to the agreed terms.   Figure 4 shows the activity diagram of the supply  customer info use case (that corresponds to a business  process).  Initially, the customer provides his personal data  that is need to be validated by the system.  In case of  successful login, the customer provides data for the  demanded products.  In the opposite case, the login process  starts from the beginning.     Fig. 4: Activity Diagram of the Supply Customer Info  Use Case   Figure 5 shows the activity diagram of the product order  business process. In the product order business process, the  customer selects a provider from the resulting catalogue  after the provision of the demand information, and then  sends to the system the order for checking.  The system  checks the availability of the requested items.  If the  requested quantity of items item is available then, the  system informs the customer who will proceed with the  final confirmation of the order.  Otherwise (shortage of  quantity) the customer has two options, to continue by  selecting another provider form the resulting catalogue or to  drop the order.     Fig. 5: Activity Diagram of the Product Order Use Case  In the following, the COSMOS environment is used for  modelling the Supply Customer Info and Product Order  business processes.  These processes are expressed as BPEL  processes.  First, the manager view of COSMOS is used for  designing these processes.
