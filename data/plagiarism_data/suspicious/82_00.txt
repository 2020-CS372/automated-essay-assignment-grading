 Fig 4 REACH Mote Flow chart 
The   wake-up   range   of   the   WISP-Mote   is 
approximately constrained to 13ft [1] due to the limited energy 
harvested by the wake up radio receiver. To increase the range 
of the radio receiver it is necessary to construct a low energy 
consuming trigger generator when compared to the WISP. 
 
The constraints included in building a trigger circuit are: 
•  Little  energy  must  be  consumed  by  the  circuit  in-order  to 
increase the wake-up range. 
•  A  rising/falling  edge  generated  by  the  circuit  must  be 
capable of driving the Tmote Sky wakeup.The  output  voltage  level  of  energy  harvesting  circuit  is 
generally unstable and hence the trigger circuit must be able to 
work on variable voltages.The trigger to the Tmote Sky mote [2] is given by the trigger 
circuit from Fig 3.This trigger circuit can generate a pulse of 
100?s duration once per second and can operating near a voltage ranging from 
1.5-5V and the current consumed in this circuit, enough to be 
driven by the lower power receiving harvester circuit, is less 
than 1?A, thereby achieving the design of low power wakeup 
receivers.REACH-Mote  (Range  Enhancing  energy  Harvester 
Mote)  ,a  wake  up  radio  sensor  node  shown  in  Fig  4  is  a 
combination  of  energy  harvesting  circuit,  wake  up  circuit  as 
well  as  Tmote  Sky.  Before  the  WuTx  transmits  the  wake-up 
signal, REACH mote is tuned to the sleep mode i.e., the MCU 
on the Tmote Sky, which is an MSP430F1611, and the radio 
are put to LPM3 sleep mode [3] .Once the DC voltage sent by 
the  harvester  circuit  is  higher  than  1.5V,  the  wake  up  circuit 
starts generating the pulse which will trigger the mote and put 
the  mote’s  MCU  into  active  mode  in  5ms  [4].If  there  is  any 
data  to  be  transferred,  then  REACH  mote  starts  the  transfer 
else it goes back to sleep mode again 
There is no drain of energy from the battery as the harvesting 
circuit  powers  the  wake  up  circuit.  Hence  all  the  energy 
provided  by  the  REACH  mote  is  used  for  sensing  and  data 
communication.
