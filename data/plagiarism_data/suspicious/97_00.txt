  First we build the security policy integrated model.  Then  from the usage view of the system the use scenarios  conformed to the model are built.  The test cases are  automatically generated from these scenarios, and on the risk  factors the test cases are organized in the process of testing.     The rest of the paper is organized as follows.  In Section  II, the overview of the scenario-based test case generation  framework is presented.  Implementation details of the  framework are described in Section III. In Section IV, the  approach is demonstrated on a simple example: the security  policy integrated workflow system.  Section V concludes the  paper.   II. SCENARIO-BASED TEST CASE GENERATION  FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW  In this section, we present our scenario-based test case  generation framework, which is depicted in Fig.1.The  Framework is designed for facilitating the security policy  testing process.  In the modeling stage, the left hand-side of  the Fig.1, functional and security requirements are integrated  as the base of modeling.  Based on the integrated  requirements the process of modeling is stepwise.  An  abstract model is first constructed and given by a number of  refinement steps a sufficiently detailed model is obtained.   The final system, the system under test (SUT), is an  implementation of this detailed model.  In the test cases  generation stage, the right hand-side of the Fig.1, scenarios  conformed to the model with the same level of abstraction  are constructed in parallel.  On the basis of the sufficiently  refined scenarios the test cases are generated and selected.
