Figure 4.2: Block Diagram for Flowchart Plagiarism Detection Process
  The detected shapes from the user query are counted and inserted in above formula of getting „q‟, which is a threshold  value that compared with the document vector in the database to check the similarity.    The text in the query flowchart is compared with text in flowcharts that are stored in the database.  The check is based on  text similarity.  The rank is calculated on the basis of this similarity of text and similarity in flowchart shapes.  On these aspect  plagiarism is decided.    International Journal of Futuristic Machine Intelligence & Application (IJFMIA)                                                                                                                                                                                    Vol. Figure 4.2: Block Diagram for Flowchart Plagiarism Detection Process          The most important part of the  figure plagiarism detection  system is the plagiarism retrieval search engine which  described in Figure 4.2. The user query is treated as a  sample figure by the search engine. The sample figure is  pre-processed to derive the query vector that will be  compared with the figure-document vectors on the metadata  database. Similarity between the query vector and each  figure-document is calculated using the cosine similarity  check.  The figure id, ranked of the most alike figures are  fetched from the database and reported to the user.                                    V. CONCLUSION  The proposed system is going to develop in such  way that it is able to retrieve figures with their certain  characteristics.  These retrieved figures are used to find out  the similarities with the prepared flowcharts of authorized  person.  The proposed system will utilize Canny Edge  detection algorithm to find out the edges of the shapes  which is a successful algorithm in image processing.  The  similarity checking between user query and the documents  stored in database is based on the figure id and ranks which  will give fine results.  Hence, the proposed system can be  helpful in such direction.
