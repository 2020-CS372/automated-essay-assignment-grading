Product Search the largest product catalog in the  world by using object-level vertical search  technologies.     2. REQUIREMENTS    The requirements for a large-scale object-level  vertical search engine are as follows:  • Reliability: Retrieve high quality structured  data to generate direct and aggregate answers.   • Completeness: Make sure the data to be as  complete as possible to provide trustworthy  answers.  • Ranking Accuracy: Optimize ranking  mechanism for locating relevant object  information.  • Scalability: Get all the information within a  vertical domain on the web and store them in  local databases.   • In the following sections, we will introduce  the system architecture and infrastructure  design with these requirements in mind. Figure 2 shows the brief architecture of an  object-level vertical search engine. First, a crawler  fetches web data related to the targeted objects  within a specific vertical domain, and the crawled  data is classified into different categories, such as  papers, authors, products, and locations.  For each  category, a specific entity extractor is built to  extract objects from the web data.  At the same  time, information about the same object is  aggregated from multiple different data sources.   Once objects are extracted and aggregated, they  are put into the object warehouses, and vertical  search engines can be constructed based on the  object warehouses.  Moreover, advanced  object-level ranking and mining techniques can be  applied to make search more accurate and  intelligent.     3.1 Crawler and Classifier    The tasks of the crawler and classifier are to  automatically collect all relevant WebPages or  documents that contain object information for a  specific vertical domain.  The crawled WebPages  or documents will be passed to the corresponding  object extractor for extracting the structured object  information and building the object warehouse.
