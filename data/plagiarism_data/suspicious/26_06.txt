Figure 4. A fragmentation lattice
1. 4.1. Fragmentation lattice Since each fragmentation is a partitioning on the set A f of attributes, the following partial order relationship can then be deﬁned on fragmentations. Figure 4. A fragmentation lattice R of attributes to be fragmented, and two fragmentations F i ={F i 1 ,...,F i n } and F j ={F j 1 ,...,F j m } for R on A f , F j dominatesF i , denotedF j F i ,iff∀a∈A f , the fragmentF j k containing a is a subset of the fragment F i l containing a. By Deﬁnition 2. 2, the fragments composing a frag- mentation cannot have common attributes, therefore any solution F i directly dominated by F j is obtained by merging two fragments in F j .  For instance, fragmenta- tion F 1 ={{Name},{Occup, ZIP},{Sickness}} directly dominates F 2 ={{Name, Occup, ZIP},{Sickness}}, which is obtained by merging{Name} and{Occup,ZIP}.  Deﬁnition 4.2 (Fragmentation lattice): Given a relation schema R,aset C of well deﬁned constraints over R, and a setA f ⊆ R of attributes to be fragmented, the fragmentation lattice is a pair (F,), where F is the set of all fragmen- tations of R on A f and  is the dominance relationship among fragmentations as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 4. 1. The top element F  of the lattice represents a frag- mentation where each attribute in A f appears in different fragments.  The bottom elementF ⊥ of the lattice represents a fragmentation composed of a single fragment containing all attributes inA f .  Figure 4 illustrates the fragmentation lattice for the example in  Figure 1. Here, attributes inA f ={Name, Occup,Sickness,ZIP} are represented with their initials (i.e.,N,O,S, andZ) and fragments are divided by a vertical line. Also, safe fragmentations (Deﬁnition 2. 3) are framed by solid boxes and unsafe fragmentations by dotted boxes.  An interesting property of the fragmentation lattice is that given an unsafe fragmentation F j , any fragmentation F i such that F j F i is unsafe.  Also, the cost of computing queries is monotonic with respect to the dominance rela- tionship .  2 Theorem 4.1: Given a fragmentation lattice (F,), ∀F i ,F j ∈F, F j F i , F j unsafe⇒F i unsafe.  Theorem 4.2 (Monotonicity): Given a relation schema R, aset C of well deﬁned constraints over R,aset A f ⊆ R of attributes to be fragmented, and a query workload Q for R, ∀F i ,F j ∈F: F j F i ⇒ Cost(Q,F j )≥Cost(Q,F i ).
