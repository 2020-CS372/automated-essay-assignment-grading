Consideration of the dual channel setting, in 
which the manufacturer is both a supplier and a competitor 
to  the  retailer,  distinguishes  our  work  from  this  literature. 
We    study    retail    channel    competition    between    the 
manufacturer's  direct  channel  and  an  independent,  but  not competition at the manufacturer or retailer levels. The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In 
section  2,  we  describe  the  overall  model.  In  section  3,  we 
give consumers' channel choice. In section 4, we determine 
optimal  dual  channel  strategies  for  the  manufacturer  and 
characterize how these strategies change study with respect 
to the channel environment. In section 5 given conclusions. 
2.     The overall model 
Consider a manufacturer who sells a product through his 
direct  online  channel  and  retail  channel  during  a  sales 
season.  The   sequence   of   events   is   as   follows   (and 
summarized in Figure 1). During the contracting stage, the manufacturer sets the 
wholesale price w and offers the contract to the retailer. If 
the    retailer    accepts    the    contract,    the    manufacturer 
establishes  a  retail  channel  to  sell  his  product.  Given  the 
wholesale  price,  both  firms  make  operational  decisions 
without  observing  each  other's  actions.  In  particular,  the 
retailer  chooses  an  inventory  level  without  observing  the 
manufacturer's  decision  for  the  direct  channel.    Choosing 
an inventory level is equivalent to setting the service level s, 
the probability of not stocking out during the sales season. 
The  problem  can  be  formulated  in  either  variable.  The 
manufacturer  sets  the  delivery  lead  time  t  in  the  direct 
channel  without  observing  the  retailer's  decision.  During 
the  sales  season,  consumers  decide  which  channel  to  buy 
from (consumers' channel choice).
