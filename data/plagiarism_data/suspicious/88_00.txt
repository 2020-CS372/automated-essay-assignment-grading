Figure 1. The proposed system framework for generic object recognition
  The original idea for interest points detector comes  from Harris corner detector[9].  It was originally used to  capture the characteristic corner and edge points in an  image.  Later, it has been extended to several improved  versions.  Based on the evaluation of interest points by  Schmid et al.[10] the improved Harris detector get better  results.  In application, the scale invariant Harris-Laplace    detector[11]   and the affine invariant interest point  detector [12]  both proposed by Mikolajczyk and Schmid are  most common ones.  Another one proposed by Lowe[13] is  also very common.   3ï¼Ž Generic object recognition system  The outline of our method is similar with the generic  object recognition framework in Ref. [4], but there are three  main differences.  Our whole system is showed in Figure.1.  Different original feature vectors are constructed from the  neighbor of extracted characteristic points in the grayscales  images.  The uniform feature vectors are created based on  clustering on the training set.  KCCA are used to build  combined feature from distinct features.  Finally, SVM is  used as the classifier.  The first difference is that we use  clustering in order to reduce the number of features.  The  second is that we apply KCCA to study the relationship  between two distinct features and obtain a new kernel  mapping function.  Finally, we use SVM instead of  Adaboost algorithm for the classification.
