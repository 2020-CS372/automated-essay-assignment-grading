Figure 1. Finite-State Machine For Group Mobility-Based Clustering
The clusters should be the basis for hierarchical routing . By using an auto- configuration mechanism, address prefixes are assigned to the clusters.  The address prefix for a cluster is maintained by the CH. Each node in a cluster has to know its address prefix.  From this requirement, it follows that only the cluster members need to know their current CH, but not vice versa.  We assume that each cluster can be identified network-wide by some unique value assigned to it.  This unique value could for example be the cluster head's MAC address.  Consequently, a node can be in four different states: It can either be no member of any cluster (un-clustered), member of exactly one cluster (clustered), the CH of exactly one cluster (CH) or have another role (guest node).  As a result of the nodes' movements, there are several possible events in the life cycle of a cluster (see Figure 1). Two nodes may meet and form a cluster, one of them declaring itselfto be CH (event create).  Nodes can be added to an existing cluster (event join).  Or two clusters may be collapsed to one (event merge).  If a cluster is split in two with one of the remaining parts having no leader, the cluster has to be "repaired" accordingly.  Nodes may depart from their clusters (event leave), and a cluster disappears when all members leave it.  A. Proactive Clustering GMBC First, ODGM/GN's precursor is described briefly.  This protocol, Group Mobility-Based Clustering (GMBC) is quite simple, therefore suitable for an introductory view on clus- tering with group mobility and lending itself to comparisons of experimental results.
