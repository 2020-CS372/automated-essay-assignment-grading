Figure 2: Diagram for extracting RAS-MFCC features similar to [6]
  We consider an additive noise model as follows:  Where x(m, n) referred as clean speech, V(m , n) represents  a additive noise and y(m, n) is a noisy speech waveform.  In  a frame, m is the frame index and n is the discrete time  index and M represents the number of frames and N the  represents frame samples.   A related autocorrelation additive equation for of cleans  speech, noisy speech and noise on the condition that noise is  considered to be uncorrelated with speech  Where  fxx (m, k) referred as SAS of Clean Speech  fyy (m, k) referred as the Noisy Speech  fvv (m, k) referred as additive noise  k is the autocorrelation sequence index IEEE Sponsored 2nd Internotionol Conference on Innovotions in Informotion, Embedded ond Communicotion systems  (ICIIECS) 2015  If the additive noise is assumed to have the same values for  all frames. Figure 1: Diagram for extracting RPMCC features [11]. The  subband weighting is applied according to (6) and (7).   Figure 2: Diagram for extracting RAS-MFCC features  similar to [6]  Therefore, we can compute the differentiation of both sides  of (IO) with respect to m, to calculate the RAS of noisy and  clean speech, which yields [6]  uryy (rn,k)  Um  urxx (III, k)  Urn  o � 111 � M - 1,  (11 )  O�k�N -l.   This differentiation can be acquired by FIR filter on the  temporal autocorrelation trajectory.  Then the transfer  function is [6]:  1 Q  H(z) = L tzt,  TQ t=-Q  Where  (12)  Q  TQ = 2: t2,  t= - Q  (13)  Where (2Q + 1) is the frame range of the applying filter.   In Figure 2, shows the block diagram for extracting the  features of RAS MFCC. We have varied the approach  proposed in [6] by including a hamming window at the  beginning of the process to make it similar to other speech  feature extraction methods.  Therefore, for applying the RAS  filter to find the correct power spectrum, a DDR (double  dynamic range) hamming window is required.  The reason  for adding this block is that the power spectrum of an  autocorrelation sequence has a dynamic range twice that of  the corresponding power spectrum of the signa\.  Therefore,  to build an N-Iength DDR hamming window, the following  procedure is adopt that is similar to [5]:  1.  Construct Hamming window with an NI2 length  2.  Compute its (N-I) length two sided  autocorrelation sequence, has a maximum at  zeroth lag in the center,  3.  Pad one zero at the end to make a N-Iength desired  window.
