11 network, it would like to  change the connection to WLAN to obtain higher  bandwidth.  Since the WMAN is always on, the handoff  cannot be triggered by signal decay of the IEEE 802. 16  network. We can utilize the bandwidth as handoff  metric.    In this section the adaptive fuzzy logic based handoff  algorithm for hybrid networks [8] is presented.  Figure  5 depicts the algorithm.  The difference from the  conventional decision mechanism is that, here the  metric is bandwidth not RSS and HYS L  and HYS W   values are updated by a fuzzy logic system.     Figure 5. Bandwidth based adaptive fuzzy logic  handoff algorithm for hybrid networks   Handoff decision mechanism is illustrated in  Figure  6 and Figure 7.  1) When the current cell is a WMAN (Figure 6), since  the priority is to make handoff to WLAN, first  bandwidth of the suggested WLAN is checked. If  BW L  exceeds the threshold (TH L ) by an amount  HYS L , handoff will be done to the best WLAN;  otherwise handoff to the best WMAN is  investigated.  If BW W  exceeds the current bandwidth  (BWc) by an amount HYS W , handoff is made to the  best WMAN, otherwise no handoff occurs.      Figure 6. Handoff decision method (current WMAN)  2) When the current cell is a WLAN ( Figure 7), first  the best WLAN is investigated. If BWL exceeds  BWc by an amount HYSL, handoff will be done to  the best WLAN; else an attempt is made for  handoff to the best WMAN. If BWW exceeds THW  by an amount HYSW, handoff will be done to the  best WMAN, otherwise no handoff occurs.     Figure 7. Handoff decision method (current WLAN)    In this algorithm mobile host speed and traffic in the  WLAN are used as input parameters.  Methods for  estimating the speed of mobile hosts, which are based  on Doppler frequency, are proposed in [9].  Averaging  window is adapted according to mobile host speed.
