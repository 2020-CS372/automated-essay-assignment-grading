Fig. 1. EECC pricing architectures
  The first problem, timely feedback, is relatively very hard  to achieve in a wide area network such as the Internet.  In Ref.  [4], the authors showed that users do want feedback about  charging of the network service (such as current price and  prediction of service quality in near future).  However, in Ref.  [5], the authors illustrated that congestion control by pricing  cannot be achieved if price changes are performed at a time- scale larger than roughly 40 roundtrip-times (RTTs).  This  means that in order to achieve congestion control by pricing,  service prices must be updated very frequently (i.e.  2â€“3 s since  RTT is expressed in terms of milliseconds for most cases in the  Internet).   The second problem, congestion information, is also very  hard to solve in a way that does not require a major upgrade at  network routers[6].    In order to solve these problems above, we propose edge to  edge capacity contracting (EECC) pricing solutions.   EECC pricing architectures is shown in Fig.1. EECC  models a short-term contract for a given traffic class as a  function of price per unit traffic volume P v ; maximum volume       V max  (maximum number of bytes that can be sent during the  contract) and the term of the contract T (length of the contract):  Contract =f (P v ,V max ,T).                         (1)  Customers can only access network core by making  contracts with the provider stations placed at the edge routers.   The stations offer contracts (i.e.  Vmax and T) to fellow users.   Notice that, in EECC framework, provider stations can  implement dynamic pricing schemes.  Particularly, they can  implement congestion-based pricing schemes, if they have  actual information about congestion in network core.  This  congestion information can come from the interior routers or  from the egress edge routers depending on the congestion- detection mechanism being used.  EECC assumes that the  congestion detection mechanism is able to give congestion  information in time scales smaller than contracts.
