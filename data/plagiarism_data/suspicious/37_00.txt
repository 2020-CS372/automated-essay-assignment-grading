 Ever increasing miniaturization of electronic components has led to important advances FPGA susceptible to transient faults induced by radiation performance. [1], [2].  These intermittent faults do not provoke a permanent damage, but may result in the incorrect execution of the program by altering signal transfers or stored values, these faults are also called soft errors [3].  Although these faults are more frequent in the space environment, they are also present to in the atmosphere [4] and even at ground level [5], [6].  In the proposed work fault tolerance achieved by depth packet inspection.  Depth Packet Inspection called complete packet inspection Information extraction is a form of computer network packet filter in that examines the data part and possibly also the header of a packet as it passes an inspection point, searching for protocol nonÂ­ compliance, intrusions, or defined criteria to decide whether the packet may pass or needs to be routed to a different destination and statistical information.  Depth packet Inspector can handle compressed data.  The proposed work is simulated by using model sim software and VHDL language used.  Fig 1.The Block diagram description in fault tolerant embedded design are.  Fig. 1: Block Diagram of Fault Tolerant Embedded System Basic Design II. FAULT TOLERANT EMBEDDED SYSTEM BASIC DESIGN The proposed system consist of six modules are depth packet inspector, interface system, fault tolerant monitor, memory, router, Embedded core.  This project uses FPGA Cyclone IV as processor.  Global network is a multiple system.  Data from multiple system routed to switching circuit.  Switching circuit switch the data to Depth packet inspector.  In depth packet inspector fault tolerant provided for fault data.
