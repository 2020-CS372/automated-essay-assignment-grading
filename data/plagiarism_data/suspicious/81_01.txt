 Such a system-on-chip (SOC) approach is very  attractive from the designers’ perspective.  Testing of  such systems, on the other hand, is a problematic and  time consuming task, mainly due to the resulting IC’s  complexity and the high integration density.   The main idea of a BIST approach is to eliminate  or reduce the need for an external tester by integrating  active test infrastructure onto the chip.  The test  patterns are not any more generated externally, as it is  done with ATE, but internally, using special BIST  circuitry.  BIST techniques can be divided into off line  and on-line techniques .  On-line BIST is performed  during normal functional operation of the chip, either  when the system is in idle state or not.  Off-line BIST  is performed when the system is not in its normal  operational mode but in special test mode.  A typical  BIST architecture, presented in Figure 1,  consists of a  TPG, a TRA, and a BIST control unit (BCU), all  implemented on the chip [3, 4, 5, 6].  This hybrid BIST  approach is based on the intelligent combination of  pseudorandom and deterministic test sequences that  would provide a high-quality test solution under  imposed constraints.   Figure 1. A typical BIST architecture.   There are following main criteria used for  optimization of BIST design in one-core or in multi- core design: total cost minimization, time  minimization and energy minimization.  In this paper  we concentrate on hybrid BIST optimization for  multi-core designs.   As total cost minimization for multi-core systems  is an extremely complex problem and is rarely used in  reality, the main emphasis here is on test time  minimization under memory constraints with different  test architectures.  The memory constraints can be seen  as limitations of on-chip memory or ATE memory,  where the deterministic test set will be stored, and  therefore with high practical importance.
