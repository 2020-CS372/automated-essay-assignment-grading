1109/ICETET.2011.13 247PORT                      Locally  Synchronous  I island  two locally synchronous modules is presented in [8].  The  authors also propose FIFO buffering for performance  enhancement.  A four-phase version of the asynchronous  GALS wrapper, which handles multiple ports and also  facilitates testing, is presented in [9].  A number of GALS  interconnect structures and modified wrappers are analyzed in  [10], focusing on ring topology and packet based  communications.  An architecture for combining synchronous  and asynchronous modules in a GALS system is presented in  [11], employing handshake based on matched delays.  Finite- state machine (FSM)-based demand and poll port controllers  are also presented. Fig 3.1. Architecture of Delayed Latching    In an Delayed Latching input port synchronizer, the  asynchronous controller  Fig. 3.1 controls both the input latch  ‘L’ and Y1, the clock  input to the first sampling register.  Signal Y, the local clock of the module, is uninterrupted. In  addition, the port issues a valid indication for each newly  received data word and prevents WRITE after READ (WAR)  hazards.  Various modes of the DL operation are demonstrated  in Fig. 3.2.      Fig 3.2 Various modes of operation    In DL, the clock of the Locally Synchronous Island is  never stopped.  The only measure available is to delay Y1+  when a conflict is imminent.  Y-  is unaffected, and only the  high phase is shortened.  A port request is accepted only during  the low-phase of Y, latching the incoming data (L+) and  delaying Y1 when needed.  The conflicts between Y+ and  REQ + are resolved by a MUTEX inside the control.    DL is unaffected by clock cycle changes that can be  caused for instance due to dynamic frequency or voltage  scaling [2]–[4].
