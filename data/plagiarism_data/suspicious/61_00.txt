Artificial Immune Recognition System    The Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS)  is a new method for data mining [10] [11] [6].  In this  section, we explore the application of the AIRS for  software quality classification.  We first prepare a pool  of recognition or memory cells (data exemplars),  which are the representatives of the training software  modules the model is exposed to.   The lifecycle of the  AIRS is illustrated in Fig. 1.    Fig. 1.  Life cycle of AIRS.    3. 1 Initialization    This step of the AIRS consists of preparing the data  and system variables for use in the training process.   The training software modules are normalized so that  the range of each metrics is within [0,1].  An affinity  measure is needed in the training process.    The maximum distance between two arbitrary data  vectors is calculated in (1), where r is the known data  range for attribute i.   2 1 n i i maxdist r = = ∑                       (1)  The affinity is a similarity value, which means the  smaller the affinity value the higher the affinity is (the  closer the vectors are to each other):  affinity = maxdist/dist.                      (2)  where dist is the Euclidean distance.   The next step is to seed the memory cell pool.
