 Recently, support vector machine  (SVM) has become a popular tool for numeral recognition  due to its remarkable characteristics such as good  generalization performance, the absence of local minima.   SVM implements the structural risk minimization principle  which seeks to minimize an upper bound of the  generalization error rather than minimizing the training error  [18].    In this paper, we present a recognition system for  handwritten Bengali numerals.  The system consists of three  main parts: preprocessing, feature extraction and  recognition.  The input of the system is the image of an  envelope and the output is the recognized Bengali numerals  of the post-code written upon the envelope.  Here we  propose a recognition approach based on the direction  feature combined with PCA and SVM. The experimental  Proceedings of 11th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT 2008) 25-27 December, 2008, Khulna, Bangladesh 1-4244-2136-7/08/$20. 00 Â©2008 IEEE 171results show that the recognition performance of the  proposed approach is superior to other conventional  recognition approaches.   III. MATERIALS AND METHODS   The overall system is represented in Fig.1. Here the  preprocessing phase consists of post-code box detection,  segmentation, normalization, filtering, thinning and dilation.   In the dimension reduction phase Kirsch mask and the PCA  method are applied.  Then the SVM is trained up.  And in the  recognition phase the numeral characters are recognized. Fig. 1. Block diagram of the proposed system    A. Preprocessing  The goal of this part is to extract numeral images of  postcode from an envelope image for the subsequent  recognition. In Bangladeshi postal documents there are pre- printed boxes to write post-code.  We call these boxes as  post-code boxes.  People generally write the destination  post-code of four digits inside these boxes.
