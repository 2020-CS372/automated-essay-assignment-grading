 If it does not have to be change then the element of the set will not be affected by this module and these is no need to recalculate the cost and mark.  4- Update the set if needed, the set will need to be updated after every change to any module with restriction that the update will be only to mark or adding new element to the set, but no deletion is allowed.  While updating the set if the module already exists in the set then increase the mark by one.  If the element is not in the list then add it and set the cost to zero and the mark to one.  The cost will be reset to zero for all element because it will be recalculated.  The steps from 2 to 4 will be repeated until the set be empty.  Note that ifno change to the module in step 4, then the cost will remain the same. Figure 3 is really an expansion to  figure 2; it shows a graph which represents seven modules in a system. Assume that a change is done on Module C, and then the following iteration will tale place: Iteration 1: 1- The affected set will be constructed: {(A,O, 1 ),(B,O, 1 ),(D,O, 1) ,(M,O, 1) } 2- The cost for every element in the set will be calculated TCSET'2006, February 28-March 4, 2006, Lviv-Slavsko, Ukraine30 {(A,5, 1 ),(B,3, 1 ),(D,0,2), (M,O, 1) } 3- Remove Module A from the set and trace it, assume that it needs a change. 4- Update the set {(B,0,2),(D,0,2),(M,O,1), (H,O,1), (C,O 1), (N,O,l) } Iteration 2.  1- The cost will be calculated for all elements in the set, note that while recalculate the cost I and 0 will remain the same in this example, but actually it may change during the system maintenance phase. {(B,5,2),(D,4,2),(M, 1,1) ,(H,2, 1) ,(C,4, I) ,(N, 1,1) } 2- Trace module B. Again assume that it needs a change.  3- Update the set: {(D,0,2),(M,0, I ),(H,0,2) ,(C,0. 2) ,(N,O, 1 ),(A,O, 1) } Iteration 3.  1- Recalculate the cost {(D,4,2),(M, 1,1) ,(H,4,2) ,(C,6,2) ,(N, 1,1 ),(A,5, 1) 2- Trace module C. Change. Fig.3: Directed graph reflect the dependency between modules Iteration 4: 1- Recalculate the cost {(D,5,3),(M,3 ,2) ,(H,4,2) ,(N,2, 1 ),(A,7,2),(B,4, 1) } 2- Trace module A. No need to Change. Iteration 5: {(D,5,3),(M,3 ,2) ,(H,4,2) ,(N,2, I ),(B,4, I) } Trace module D. No need to Change.
