  III. SLA MODELING AND FORMAL DESCRIPTION  Some solutions for SLA modeling and formal description  have been brought forward from both academic and industry,  such as WSLA [5] (Web service Level Agreements) by IBM,  WSML [6] (Web Service Management Language) by HP and  WSOL [7] (Web Service Offering Language) by Carleton  University.     WSLA and WSML describe the details of QoS constraints  but do not concern about functional constraints and other  binding norms of web services.  They assumed that both  services providers and customers must have the measurement  and management infrastructure that makes the solutions  complicated and costly.   WSOL describes the web service class, various constraints  (functional constraints, QoS, and access permissions) and the  management statement (signed agreements, cost per access,  fine as well as management responsibilities).  Based on WSDL  [8] (Web services description Language), further describing of  the provisioning of web services using WSOL makes the  monitoring and assessment of web services feasible.   To implement SLA, the primary question is: “What do we  want to monitor?” To answer this question, we have built a  QoS model [9] including some technical characteristics and  non-technical characteristics based on quality-related standards  especially in the domain of web services.  This model was part of our participation in a National Key project of Scientific and  Technical Supporting Programs of China, CSIS (Common  Services Integration System), in which we participated with  the responsibility of identifying and classifying the  characteristics needed for defining the quality of Web services.   The simplified QoS model (shown in figure 3) is partly based  on the ISO/IEC 9126 standard [10].  However, since this  standard focuses just on the technical aspects of software, we  have utilized some previous work to enlarge this model  including non-technical aspects.     Figure 3. The simplified QoS model for web service  We define the SLA-based QoS model as (1):  Q(S) = {A, T, F, C, R…}.                          (1)  In this model, “A” represents availability, “T” represents  response time, “F” means fault recovery time, “C means  service cost and “R” stands for reputation.   Each indicator in this model comprises four items as in (2).         {Name, ComparisionOp, Val, Unit}.                   (2)  “Name” means the name of the indicator,  “ComparisionOp” stands for comparison operator, “Val”  represents bound value and “Unit” stands for metrics unit.   There is an example of the model showed in the following  table.    TABLE I.  AN EXAMPLE OF QOS MODEL  Name ComparisionOp Val Unit  A: Availability >= 0. 7 null  T: ResponseTime <= 10 ms  F: FaultRecoverT <= 500 ms  C: Cost = 55 yuan  R: Reputation = 6 null  Some features of WSOL such as service class, constraints  and the management statement could support the model  appropriately and we choose related subset of WSOL for the  formal description of the SLA model.
