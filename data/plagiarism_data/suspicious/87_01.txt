 If the robot is detected only at the goal, then  i γ equals 1.   The obstacle antibody antibody  o i a and the goal antibody  g i a in an immune network are derived as follows [21]:  o i o i o i Ab N l o l oss il o i o i o i Ab o N oss iN o oss i o oss i o i o i o i Ab o N osu i N ost iN o osu i ost i o osu i ost i o i o i o i Ab o N osu i N o osu i o osu i Ab o N ost iN o ost i o ost i o i o i o i Ab N k o l osu ki Ab N l o l ost il o i a k m N a m a k m N a m a m a m a k m N a m m a m m a m m a k m N a m a m a m N a m a m a m a k m N a m N a m a Ab Ab Ab Ab Ab Ab Ab Ab Ab Ab Ab Ab ⋅ + ⋅ = ⋅ + ⋅ + + ⋅ + ⋅ = ⋅ + ⋅ − + + ⋅ − + ⋅ − = ⋅ + ⋅ + + ⋅ + ⋅ ⋅ + + ⋅ + ⋅ = ⋅ − + ⋅ − ⋅ = ¦ ¦ ¦ = = = ) - / (     ] -        / ) [(     } - / ] ) (        ) ( ) {[(     ] -       / ) ( -       / ) [(     ) ( 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 " " " "      (9)  g i g i g i Ab N l g l gss il g i g i g i Ab N k g l gsu ki Ab N l g l gst il g i a k m N a m a k m N a m N a m a Ab Ab Ab ⋅ + ⋅ == ⋅ − + ⋅ − ⋅ = ¦ ¦ ¦ = = = ) - / (     ) ( 1 1 1   (10)  where i,l,k = 0,1,…,N Ab  is are the subscripts to distinguish the  antibody types and N Ab  is the number of antibody.  Eq.(9) is  composed of four terms.  The first term on the right hand  shows the degree of stimulation by other antibodies, while the  second term depicts the suppressive interaction between the  antibodies.  The third term represents the external input from  the antigents. and the final term is the natural extinction term,  which indicates the dissipation tendency in the absence of any  interaction.  o i a and  g i a can be calculated using similarly  method.  ost il m and osu ki m indicate the obstacle stimulative and  suppressive affinity between the ith and the lth, kth antibodies,  respectively.  o i m and g i m denote the affinity of antigen and  antibody,  o i k and g i k represent the natural death coefficient.

D AIA based Algorithm for Mobile Robot Path Planning  When the robot gets the task, it saves the start point and goal  point information.  The flow chart of the algorithm can be  depicted as Fig. 6.

The mobile robot work space of 2 [m]×2[m] wide.  The size of  robot is 60[mm] in diameter.    This simulation experiment mainly aims to compare and  analyze the differences between the artificial immune research  method, and the genetic algorithm (GA) proposed by Lu [22],  and present the experiment results.  Mobile robot needs to  avoid five static obstacles to reach the target object and fulfill  its task.   A Comparison between AIA and GA simulation   Fig. Ā Ϥ ā is the AIA simulation result of the eighth  generation number of the mobile robot, and 54 steps will be  needed before reaching the target object.  Fig. Ā ϭ ā is the  GA simulation drawing proposed by Lu.
