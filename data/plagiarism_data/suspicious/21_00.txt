  Step 2:Get the output current of DG, ) ( i DG T I .      Step 3:Use equations (9) and (11) to calculate  ) ( 0 x P loss  and  find the solution  0 x of equation (13).   Step 4:Use equations (6) and (10) to check whether the  voltage regulation is satisfied.    Step 5:If all the voltages are in the acceptable range, then the  calculated  0 x is the optimal spot ( op x ) to add DG.   Step 6:If  0 x doesn’t meet the voltage regulation rule, then  move the DG to see whether there is a point around  point  0 x , where all bus voltages are in the acceptable  range.    Step 7:If no point on the feeder can satisfy the voltage  regulation rule, then increase the size of DG and  repeat steps 2 to 7.    Step 8:Sometimes more than one DG may be needed.  Under  this situation, the feeder can be divided into several  segments and steps 1 to 7 can be applied to each  segment.    The flow chart of the procedure is shown in Figure 2.    Figure 2.  Procedure for finding optimal place for a DG source in a radial  feeder.   IV. CASE STUDIES WITH TIME INVARIANT LOADS AND  DGS  Table Ⅰshows the results of analyses, using the foregoing  procedure, to find the optimal location for placing DG on  radial feeders with three different load distributions:  uniformly distributed load, centrally distributed load and  uniformly increasing distributed load.  In the results given in  Table Ⅰ, it is assumed that the DG supplies all the loads on  the feeder in each case, and the distribution system supplies  the system losses.  It is noted from the table that the DG  reduces the system power losses significantly when it is  located properly.      TABLE I.

For a uniformly  distributed load, if the DG supplies 2/3 of the total load    ( 6 2 l I I ld DG = ), the optimal site is at 3 0 l x = according  to equation (9).
