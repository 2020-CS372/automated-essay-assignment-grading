 Thus, the fastest high phase (50% of the clock  cycle) is about 50 inverter delays long.  In order to assess the  worst-case MTBF in the following equation, we assume that  τ  and ‘W’ are one and two FO4 inverter delays, respectively,  [24], F D  = F C  (worst-case analysis), the clock cycle T=100τ  and, thus, F C   = F D  = 1/100τ .  We can determine the required  metastability resolution time in terms of a number of gate  delays, by solving          L  A  T  C  H        RE G1      RE G2  CL  DA INPU       CONT ROL  LOCAL CLOCK  GENERATOR  L  Y1 Y REQ  ACK  248 248    For 10 -11  < τ< 10 -10  s (the range of FO4 gate delays in present  and foreseeable technologies, ) (15) For T= 100τ , this implies  that at least one half of a symmetric clock cycle should be  allowed for resolution.  For slower SoCs, e.g., where the fastest  clock cycle is 160τ [26], a quarter clock cycle suffices to  achieve this MTBF. For most aggressive designs [such as  high-speed processors or high-speed application- specified  integrated circuit (ASIC) modules], where 10τ < T < 50τ a  different approach based on multicycle resolution time or on  multisynchronous clocking [27] is required.     3.2 DL Constraints    We require that to guarantee minimal high clock phase    Leading to a constraint on the asynchronous control delay                 (1)  Another constraint applies to D L , the delay of the  combinational logic that follows REG1.  When the rising edge  of Y1 is delayed, the effective computation time in that logic  stage becomes shorter than the clock cycle.  Therefore, the  following should be satisfied.        (2)  D CTRL  contains additional buffering delays when wide data path is  required. Fig.4.1 shows a possible implementation of  Fig. 3.1.  Without a conflict, Y1+ is either not delayed or delayed by  less than D CTRL  .R2’+ is granted only during the low-phase of  Y . The MUTEX arbitrates any conflict between R2’+ and Y+  .  When R2’+ wins over Y+ , the asynchronous controller is  granted (R3+) .  The controller employs an asymmetric  matched delay Do --Di to open the latch and then close it  again (L+ - L-).  The asymmetric delay applies a longer  delay to one of the two edges.  In our case, the delay is  minimal for the falling edge and is longer for the rising one.   The long delay matches the latch propagation delay for all  corners and delay variations.
