 This design  was a carryover from porcelain arresters.  The second design,  targeted specifically to polymer arresters, integrates the  disconnector into the body of the insulating bracket.  This  integrated designs attaches to the base end of the arrester.   Regardless of which approach is utilized, both designs use  the same basic internal design approach.  An unprimed  cartridge is used to promote separation of the disconnector.   This cartridge is typically located in the vicinity of a sparkgap,  which is oriented in parallel with some type of electrical  grading component.  Manufacturers have utilized a variety of  grading components, including electronic capacitors,  electronic resistors, conductive polymers, and higher wattage  resistors.  Figure 1 shows an electrical schematic of a typical  ground lead disconnector.  The sparkgap, located electrically in  parallel with the resistor, provides a bypass function when the  arrester assembly is subjected to abnormal surge duty.  Voltage  drop across the grading component during this abnormal surge  duty causes the bypass gap to sparkover.  For required arrester  durability tests defined in the standard, the arrester is expected  to withstand the duty without failing and the detonator is  expected to withstand the duty without detonating.   Fig. 1. Electrical schematic of ground lead disconnector.   The thermal design of the disconnector is such that there is  not sufficient coulomb content in the sparkgap region to cause  the adjacent cartridge to detonate during arrester durability  tests.  However, if the surge duty is sufficient to cause the  arrester to fail, the subsequent flow of system fault current  available at the arrester location is intended to provide  sufficient heating of the cartridge to cause it to detonate.
