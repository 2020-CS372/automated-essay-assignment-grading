Fig. 1: Steps to follow to propagate the change
 When a module changed a set of modules will be affected and need to be traced in order to keep consistency between system modules.  A specific path will be followed to handle the change propagation.  To determine this path a set of all affected modules will be generated according the module neighbors.  A module is considered to be a neighbor to other module if there is an arrow between the two modules.  Each element in the set will be given two values, number of marks plus a cost.  Then a heuristic function will be calculated to determine the module that will be select from the set and handled.  After handling the module the set will need to be updated then the steps will be repeated to select another module to be handled.  Figure 1 show these steps.  TCSET'2006, February 28-March 4, 2006, Lviv-Slavsko, Ukraine29 Fig. 1: Steps to follow to propagate the change IJ.B HEURISTICMODEL ENCOMPASSING RIPPLE EFFECT (HRE) To keep track on the ripple effect, and to be sure that the change propagation in a way that keep the dependency between module consistent, a model is constructed to choose the module which will be traced from a set of affected modules.  This model depends on the graph representation and the heuristic function.  The following steps show how this model works: 1- Define the set of affected modules, the set will look like: {(modulel, mark,, costl), (module2, mark2, cost2)... (module., mark., cost-) ......  Where: module, The ith module in the set mark, Number of marks assign to the ith module, initially set to 1 costs The cost assign to the ith module, initially set to 0 These modules in the set will be in the module's neighbor.  Module neighbors set in the set of all modules with have direct arrow to the changed module.  For example ifmodule C in figure 2 is changed then the module neighbors set will contain A, B, D, M. All these modules will be marked as 1, and have a cost equal to zero.
