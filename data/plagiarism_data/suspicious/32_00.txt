Figure 1.  Flowchart for the reactive power control planning to increase voltage stability margin
 A sequence of MILP with updated  margin sensitivities is proposed to refine control amounts  and/or locations from the initial MILP result until the  voltage stability margin requirement is satisfied and there is  no significant movement of the decision variables from the  mixed integer programming (MIP) solution.  The  continuation power flow (CPF) program is utilized to check  the true voltage stability margin after each MILP. This  iterative process is required to account for system  nonlinearities.  The branch-and-bound and primal-dual  interior-point methods [10] are used to solve the  optimization problem.  Because the optimization formulation  is linear, it is fast, yet it provides good solutions for large- scale power systems compared with nonlinear optimization  formulations.     The following assumptions are made in this paper:  • The system planner has identified a-priori lines  where series compensation would create sub- synchronous resonance (SSR) risk and has  eliminated those lines from the list of candidates.  • Voltage magnitude control is addressed as a  refinement following identification of the reactive  power resources necessary to satisfy the voltage  stability margin requirements.    II. ALGORITHM OF REACTIVE POWER CONTROL  PLANNING   The proposed reactive power control planning approach  requires three stages: (1) select candidate control locations,  978-1-4244-5392-4/10/$26. 00 ©2010 IEEE  (2) use MIP to estimate control locations and amounts from  stage 1 locations, and (3) use MIP with updated information  to refine control amounts and/or locations from stage 2  locations and amounts.  The overall procedure for the  reactive power control planning is shown in Figure 1 which  integrates the above mentioned steps.    Figure 1.  Flowchart for the reactive power control planning to increase voltage stability margin A. Selection of Candidate Control Locations  The backward/forward search algorithm with linear  complexity is  used to find candidate locations separately for  switched shunt and switched series capacitors under every  contingency.   B. Formulation of Initial Mixed Integer Programming  In stage 1, we find the candidate locations for switched  shunt and series capacitors separately.  In this stage, we use a  mixed integer programming (MIP) to estimate control  locations and amounts from candidate control locations.  The  MIP minimizes the total control installation cost while  increasing the voltage stability margin to a required  percentage x for each concerned contingency.  minimize  ∑ ∑ Ω ∈ Ω ∈ + + + = 2 1 ) ( ) ( j j fj j vj i i fi i vi q C X C q C B C J     (1)  subject to  k xP M X S B S j l k k j k j i k i k i ∀ ≥ + + ∑ ∑ Ω ∈ Ω ∈ , 2 1 0 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (      (2)                         k B B B i k i i ∀ ≤ ≤ , ) ( min                          (3)                              k X X X j k j j ∀ ≤ ≤ , ) ( min                       (4)          i i i i i q B B q B max min ≤ ≤                       (5)                        j j j j j q X X q X max min ≤ ≤                    (6)   1 , 0 , = j i q q                                 (7)  The decision variables are  , ) ( ) ( , , , , j k j i i k i X X q B B and  j q .

Note that, we identify the minimum set of switched  shunt and series capacitors to restore equilibrium points  under severe contingencies using the successive MIP. We  may then increase the voltage stability margin for these  contingencies to the required value along with other  contingencies having insufficient voltage stability margin.
