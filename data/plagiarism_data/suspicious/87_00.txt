 B-cells take part in  humoral immunity that secrete antibodies by the clonal  proliferation, and T-cells take part in cell mediated immunity.   One class of the T-cells, called the Killer T-cells, destroys the  infected cell whenever it recognizes the infection.  The other  class that triggers clonal expansion and stimulates or  suppresses antibody formation is called the Helper T-cells.   Each of B-cells has distinct molecular structure and produces  'Y' shaped antibodies from its surfaces.  The antibody  recognizes antigen that is foreign material and eliminates it.   This antigen-antibody relation is innate immune response.    Fig. 1 Illustration of the biological immune system   Fig. 1 depicts the model describing the relationship between  components on the immune system. When an infectious  foreign pathogen attacks the human body, the innate immune  system is activated as the first line of defense.  Innate  immunity is not directed in any way towards specific invaders  but against any pathogens that enter the body.  It is called the  non-specific immune response.  The most important cell in  innate immunity is a phagocyte including monocytes,  macrophages, etc.  The phagocyte internalizes and destroys the  invaders to the human body.  Then the phagocyte becomes an  Antigen Presenting Cell (APC).  The APC interprets the  antigen appendage and extracts the features by processing and  presenting antigenic peptides on its surface to the T-cells and  B-cells.
