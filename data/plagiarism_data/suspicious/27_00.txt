 AHP is preferred in  this study since it aligns with our classification and  hierarchical approaches represented in our model.   Additionally, AHP has been proven as the most widely used  technique of multi-criteria decision making during the last  twenty five years or more [10].     With AHP, a complex decision problem (with tangible  and intangible factors) can be developed properly.  Further,  decision makers may perform both qualitative and  quantitative analysis simultaneously with this technique.   In general, AHP can be easily applied in four simple  steps below [11]:      Step 1.  Structure the problem into hierarchy.          This consists of decomposition of the problem   into  elements based to its characteristics and    the     formation  . As can be seen in figure 1, the model consists of three  levels (goal, criteria and alternatives).         Step 2. Comparing and obtaining the judgment matrix.              In this step, the elements of a particular level are  compared with respect to a specific element in the  immediate upper level.  The resulting weights of the  elements may be called the local weights.        Step 3: Local weights and consistency of comparisons.       Here, local weights of the elements are calculated from  the judgment matrices using the eigenvector method  (EVM).      Step 4: Aggregation of weights across various levels to  obtain the final weights of alternatives.
