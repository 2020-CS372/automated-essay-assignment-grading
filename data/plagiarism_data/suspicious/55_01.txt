Communication  protocol engine of the communication process state as  follows of the agent:  State inner ::=Started| Requested | Accepted | Refused |  Promised | Informed | Advised | CAd-vised | Timeout |  Stopped  See Fig.1: Agent automatic negotiation protocol can be  divided into information transmission layer, buffer channel  layer and Agent negotiation protocol layer from bottom to  top, of which buffer channel layer C is one of the needed  layers between Agents to realize asynchronous  communication.  If it will realize point-to-point synchronous  communication between Agents, it can do communication  directly through channel C. As to the description of Agent  automatic negotiation, it mostly focus on Agent negotiation  protocol layer, while for the other layers, it only describes  their services and running environment in brief.  In essence,  the function of Agent negotiation protocol layer is the  description of process.  (1) The service provided by each protocol layer  See Fig.1:                    Figure 1.

Agent A for the  suggestion of Agent B can operation proceeding as follows:  Accept, reject and put forward the counterproposal. either  that of toward Agent A counterproposal, Agent B  receivability, reject or set own the other one proposal for. in  order to postamble toward consultative demonstration,  toward agent negotiation agreement avail CSP  formalization be described below of:  Agent A Agent B  Agent negotiation protocol layer ˄ NL ˅  C0 C1 information transmission layer ˄ TCP/UDP,HTTP,IIOP ˅ c0 c1 Recv:ad v Send:  Send:acp promise Requested Refused Accepted  Advised  Refused Counter- Advised Send:ref Recv:prom Send:acpt Send: req Recv:ac Recv:acp Recv:ref Send:ref Recv:adv Recv:ref 265with P S  standing for negotiatory sponsor tenor, P R   express negotiatory take tenor, adopt timeout by way of  differ state subaltern overtime event, II for consultative  interior select , ƶ for consultative external selection, the ȝ  pass to return to calculate the son for the CSP, negotiating  the run - time that inside affect time-out event, reset clock  wait for, in third time retreat out negotiation, because of  start with stop is interactive behavior that Agent negotiation  protocol machine and Agent, combine can't very much  negotiation protocol, the country contract gets after passing  conceal the operation the Agent negotiation interactive  procedure describe;  Because the whole Agent on the basis of intention of  uniting consults the agreement automatically (Joint  Intention based Agent Automated Negotiation Protocol,  JIAANP) the one that can show for a lot of Agent process is  woven in and erupted simultaneously mutually:   JIAANP= | | | P i = | | | ˄ P S ||P R ˅ among them i ę N  (3) Agent consults the working environment that the  protocol needs   a.

Because the protocol in information transmission layer  is standard, this text assumed information transmission  layer it transmits is reliable.  This is the basic demand of  Agent Negotiation Protocol in working.
