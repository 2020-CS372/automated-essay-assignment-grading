Fig.1. QR Decomposition based RLS
 Equation (2) shows the QR decomposition of the compound matrix [U|d]as,200 N. Lodha et al.  Fig.1. QR Decomposition based RLS [U d]= [Q q] .  R z 0 ς  (2) where [Q|q] is orthogonal and  R z 0 ς  is triangular matrix and z = Q T d.  Once the QRD is available, w is easily available through the process of back- substitution in (3) Rw = z. (3) Givens Rotation is applied to compound U matrix to calculate QRD. This gives QRD solution at time k.  Now, in order to calculate QRD at time k + 1 compu- tations do not start from the beginning.  QRD is recursively computed at time k+1 from time k by updating it as in (4),  R(k) z(k) u T k+1 d k+1  = Q ˆ ˆ(k+1).  R(k+1) z(k+1) 0 ∗  (4) where * is a don’t care entry, left hand side matrix is a “triangular-plus-one- row-matrix” and right hand is an orthogonal times triangular matrix.  The next value of coeﬃcient w follows from the back substitution in (5) R(k+1)w(k+1)= z(k+1). (5) This constitutes the complete QRD-RLS algorithm [7].  The above procedure avoids calculating the inner product U T U and hence it is numerically more stable.  Fig. 1 shows QR decomposition based RLS algorithm. 1 CORDIC in QRD CORDIC describes a method to perform a number of functions including trigono- metric, hyperbolic and logarithmic functions.  The algorithm is iterative and uses only additions, subtractions and shift operations [9].  This makes it more suitable for hardware implementations.  CORDIC cells are used to calculate and apply the unitary transformation represented by Givens rotation. Hardware-Software Co-design of QRD-RLS Algorithm 201 Fig.2.
