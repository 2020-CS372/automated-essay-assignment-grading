 It overcomes complexity  of previous decision support methods.  In addition, it  gives a basis for eliciting, discussing, recording, and  evaluating the elements of a decision.  Moreover, it can  be used to perform combination of both qualitative and  quantitative into the same decision making  methodology.  AHP has been applied in many areas of  research including few papers in computing and  information technology [1][2].   In order to develop the AHP method, one should  follow simple steps below [22]:    Step 1.   Structure the problem into hierarchy.   This consists of decomposition of the problem into  elements based to its characteristics and the formation.   As can be seen in figure 1, the model consists of three  levels (goal, criteria and alternatives). Figure 1. Information security policy model    Step 2. Comparing and obtaining the judgment matrix.    In this step, the elements of a particular level are  compared with respect to a specific element in the  immediate upper level.  The resulting weights of the  elements may be called the local weights.     Step 3: Local weights and consistency of comparisons.    In this step, local weights of the elements are  calculated from the judgment matrices using the  eigenvector method (EVM).  The normalized  eigenvector corresponding to the principal eigenvalue  of the judgment matrix provides the weights of the  corresponding elements.
