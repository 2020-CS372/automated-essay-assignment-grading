Fig.2: Web Services Orchestration and
      2   An Overview of BPEL  The concept of Web services is to use XML defined  protocols, namely the SOAP for communication, the  WSDL for description and the Universal  Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) of  software services over the Internet for discovery.   Figure 1 presents a generic architecture of Web  services.     Fig.1: Web Services Architecture        Web services provide a basic one-way or request- response mechanism that can be used by two  systems to communicate.  Its standards are open,  cross platform, and fully aligned with Internet  standards and technologies.  However, it is widely  recognized that the interaction of several or many  Web services is often required to create business  value.  This has led to several initiatives to create  languages to express and define business processes  that coordinate Web services [8].       BPEL is an XML based language that models the  behaviour of Web services in a business process  interaction.  It is a language that models both the  orchestration and choreography aspects of a  business process (Fig. 2). Orchestration refers to the  actual execution of a business process.  It controls  the flow of the various activities internal to a  business process, like invocation of Web services,  messages handling, business logic and rules.  On the  other hand, choreography describes the interfaces  and the communication protocol between two or  more independent business processes.  It tracks the  message sequence between Web services in an  abstract manner [9].     Proceedings of the 6th WSEAS Int.  Conf. on Software Engineering, Parallel and Distributed Systems, Corfu Island, Greece, February 16-19, 2007      162  Fig.2: Web Services Orchestration and  Choreography        BPEL seems to win the race for standardisation  and global acceptance against other competitive  initiatives.  The main benefits of BPEL are:  â€¢ Support of state-full conversations: with the  correlation mechanism of BPEL a process  instance can be identified from parts of the data  of the messages it handles.
