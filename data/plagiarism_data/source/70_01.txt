Fig. 2. Proposed framework for medical image classification.
 One of the major applications of  this theory advance in recent years and are extended to data analysis [21, 22], soft decision making [23],  classification [5, 24].  This furnishes the motivation to see the viability, efficiency and effectiveness of soft set for  medical imaging data classification.  Next section discusses the proposed framework.   4. The proposed framework  The proposed framework for medical image classification consisting of six phases namely: data acquisition,  data pre-processing, data partition, soft set classifier, data analysis and performance evolution.  For each  experimental setup, the dataset will be divided into two parts, a training set and testing set.  In this way test set  identification will be classification accuracy for medical image classification.  It is expected that obtained results  will have general applicability for wide image classification applications.  Figure 2 pictorially illustrates the process  map.     Fig. 2. Proposed framework for medical image classification.   Table 3 depicts six phases engaged for proposed framework.  Each of the phases is explained briefly.
