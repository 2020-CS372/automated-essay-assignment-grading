 In the L-D projective coor- dinates, point (X:Y:Z)(Z ≠0) is corresponding to point (X/Z,  Y/Z 2 ) in the affine coordinates, and the elliptic curve  equation is simplified as below.    Y 2 +XYZ = X 3 Z+aX 2 Z 2 +bZ 4                       (2)  Research work shows that point arithmetic in L-D  projective coordinates is the most efficient one.  All of the  following algorithms in this paper about the point  operation are in L-D projective coordinates.    Third International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC 2007) 0-7695-2875-9/07 $25. 00  © 2007Scalar multiplication, based on the point arithmetic on  elliptic curve, is another crucial arithmetic.  The elliptic  curve scalar multiplication is computed by repeated point  addition such as  ... k PPPkPQ ++ + = ⋅= 14 4244 3                    (3)  Where k is a positive integer and P and Q are points  on elliptic curve. Figure 1. Computing hierarchy of ECC arithmetic  The hierarchy of arithmetic for elliptic curve scalar  multiplication is depicted in  Figure 1, where FF-Mult  represents finite field multiplication, FF-Add represents  finite field adding, FF-Square represents finite field  squaring, EC-Add represents addition on elliptic curve,  and so on [4].    3. Arithmetic over Binary Finite Field    The most important arithmetic over binary finite field  is modular multiplication; hence it is necessary to design  an efficient multiplier, which depends on basis choice for  given finite field. Considering resource consumption,  both shifted canonical basis and type II optimal normal  basis are utilized in our design to achieve the efficient  multiplier.   A straightforward choice for a basis is the ordered set  {1, β, β 2 ,···, β m-1 } where β ∈GF(2 m ), which is called the ca- nonical basis[6].    If the set of elements  1 24 2 { , , ,..., } m M ββ β β − =  forms a  basis for some β ∈GF(2 m ), then the basis M is called nor- mal basis and the element β is called normal element.   Furthermore, a type II optimal normal basis for the field  GF(2 m ) is constructed using the normal element β= ξ + ξ -1 ,  where ξ is a primitive (2m+1)th root of unity in binary  finite field, i.e., ξ 2m+1 =1 and ξ i  ≠1 for any 1 ≤ i<2m+1.   Consequently, type II optimal normal basis can also be  expressed as   22 (1)(1) 1 ,, ,, } { mm M ξξ ξ ξ ξ ξ ξ ξ −− − 2 −2 2 −2 2 −2 =+ + + ⋅⋅⋅ + (4)  In fact, there is another basis N={ β, β 2 ,···, β m-1 , β m },  where β i = ξ i  + ξ -i , so the basis N can be expressed as   133 ,, ,, } { mm N ξξ ξ ξ ξ ξ ξ ξ −2 −2 − − = + + + ⋅⋅⋅ +       (5)  There exists a relationship between the representation  basis M and N. Basis N (also called shifted canonical ba- sis) can be obtained by a simple permutation of the basis  elements in M. As a result of the following presented  facts, the basis element of the form  ii ξ ξ 2−2 + (i ∈[1,m])  can be written uniquely as ξ   j + ξ -j  (j ∈[1,m]).     The representation of field element A with type II op- timal normal basis is given as  1 '2 0 i m i i Aa β − = = ∑                              (6)  The bases M and N are equivalent.  The representation  of field element A with canonical basis is given as  1 m ii i A a β = = ∑                                 (7)  The permutation between the coefficients a j  = a ′ i  can  be expressed as                       [1, ] (2 1)       [ 1, 2 ] kkm j mk km m ∈ ⎧ = ⎨ +− ∈ + ⎩               (8)  Where k=2 i-1  (mod 2m+1) for i = 1, 2, ···,m.
