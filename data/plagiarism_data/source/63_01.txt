 3. The Proposed New Front-End Based on Robust MVDR Spectrum of Filtered Autocorrelation Sequence Weassumeanadditivenoisemodelasfollows: 𝑦 (𝑚,𝑛 )=𝑥 (𝑚,𝑛 ) +V(𝑚,𝑛 ),0≤𝑚≤𝑀−1, 0≤𝑛≤𝑁−1, (8) where 𝑥(𝑚,𝑛) , 𝑦(𝑚,𝑛) ,and V(𝑚,𝑛) represent the clean speech, the noisy speech waveform, and the additive noise, respectively, 𝑚 is the frame index and 𝑛 is the discrete time index within a frame. 𝑀 denotes the number of frames and 𝑁 thenumberofsamplesineachframe.  We can have a similar additive equation for autocorrela- tionofnoisyspeech,cleanspeech,andnoiseonthecondition thatnoiseisassumedtobeuncorrelatedwithspeech 𝑟𝑦𝑦 (𝑚,𝑘 )=𝑟 𝑥𝑥 (𝑚,𝑘 )+𝑟 VV (𝑚,𝑘 ), 0≤𝑚≤𝑀−1, 0≤𝑘≤𝑁−1, (9) where 𝑟𝑥𝑥 (𝑚,𝑘) , 𝑟𝑦𝑦 (𝑚,𝑘) ,and 𝑟 VV (𝑚,𝑘) representtheshort- time autocorrelation sequences of clean speech, the noisy speech, and the additive noise, respectively, and 𝑘 is the autocorrelation sequence index.

Therefore, wecanomittheframeindex, 𝑚 ,from 𝑟 VV (𝑚,𝑘) in(9) 𝑟𝑦𝑦 (𝑚,𝑘 )=𝑟 𝑥𝑥 (𝑚,𝑘 )+𝑟 VV (𝑘 ),0≤𝑚≤𝑀−1, 0≤𝑘≤𝑁−1. (10) Hence, we can calculate the differentiation of both sides of (10) with respect to frame index 𝑚 , to find the RAS of noisy andcleanspeech,whichyields[6] 𝜕𝑟 𝑦𝑦 (𝑚,𝑘 ) 𝜕𝑚 = 𝜕𝑟 𝑥𝑥 (𝑚,𝑘 ) 𝜕𝑚 , 0≤𝑚≤𝑀−1, 0≤𝑘≤𝑁−1. (11) This differentiation can be obtained by an FIR filter on the temporal autocorrelationtrajectory.  The transfer function of thisfilterisasfollows[ 6]: 𝐻 (𝑧 ) = 1 𝑇 𝑄 𝑄 ∑ 𝑡=−𝑄 𝑡𝑧 𝑡 , (12) where 𝑇 𝑄 = 𝑄 ∑ 𝑡=−𝑄 𝑡 2 , (13) where (2𝑄 + 1) istheframerangeforapplyingthefilter.  TheblockdiagramforextractingtheRAS-MFCCfeatures is given in Figure2.Wehavechangedthestrategyproposed in [6] by adding a hamming window at the beginning of the process to make it similar to other speech feature extraction methods.  Therefore, a double-dynamic-range (DDR) ham- mingwindowisrequiredafterapplyingtheRASfiltertofind thecorrectpowerspectrum. Thereasonforaddingthisblock is that the power spectrum of an autocorrelation sequence has a dynamic range twice that of the correspondingsignal’s powerspectrum. Hence,toconstructan𝑁 -lengthDDRham- mingwindow,weperformthefollowingproceduresimilar to[5]: (i) Constructan 𝑁/2 -lengthHammingwindow, (ii) Calculateits (𝑁 − 1) -lengthtwo-sided(biased)auto- correlationsequencewhichhasamaximumatzeroth laginthecenter, (iii) Padonezeroattheendtomakean 𝑁 -lengthdesired window.  Inotherwords,theRASofcleanspeechcanbecalculated byapplyingthehigh-passfilterin( 12) to the autocorrelation of noisy speech in the frame range specified by (2𝑄 + 1) .  According to (11), as long as the additive noise is stationary, theRASofnoisyspeechwillbeequaltoRASofcleanspeech, and thus the effect of noise is removed.  However, we often encounter non-stationary additive noise in ASR systems.
