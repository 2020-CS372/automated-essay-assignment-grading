Introduction  Due to the explosive growth of information on the Internet, contemporary Internet users  may face the situation of information-overload. Studies on vector-space-modeled information  retrieval (IR) systems have applied many techniques to limit the amount and increase the  relevance of information retrieved. Relevance feedback is one of the techniques applied.  Applications of relevance feedback in vector-space-modeled IR system usually have the user  rate the retrieved documents as relevant or non-relevant, and then extract information from  the rated documents for use. In most past studies, the information extracted for application  consists of two sets of terms with frequencies: (1) terms appeared in relevant documents; (2)  terms appeared in non-relevant documents. The two sets of terms can form two vectors and a  vector merging operation based on addition and subtraction according to term relevance is  used to expand query.    In this study, we have identified additional information from among the rated documents.
