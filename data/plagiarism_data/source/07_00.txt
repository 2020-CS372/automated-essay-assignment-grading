 Experiments show that the probabilistic model can reveal interesting patterns in the underlying topics for our data set of busi- ness blogs.  4.1. Data corpus One thousand two hundred and sixty nine business blog entries were collected in two phases.  First, a small number ofblogentriesaremanuallycollectedfromvariousCEOs’s blog sites and business blog sites.  Meaningful blog entries from these blog sites were extracted and stored into our database. Eachblogentryissaved asatextﬁle initscorre- sponding category, for further text preprocessing.  For the preprocessing of the blog data, we performed lexical anal- ysisbyremovingstopwordsandstemmingusingthePorter stemmer (Porter, 1980).  The text ﬁles are then used as the input for the Text to MatrixGenerator (TMG) (Zeimpekis & Gallopoulos, 2006) to generate the term-document matrix for input to the blog search and mining system.  The overview of the system is shown in Fig. 1. Thereareatotalof86companiesrepresentedintheblog entries, and Table 3 summarizes the top companies in the BizBlogs07 data corpus, and Table 4 lists the ﬁelds in the database.  We then categorize the 1269 blog entries into four cate- gories based on the contents or the main description of the blog: Company, Finance, Marketing, and Product.  The Company category deals with news or other information speciﬁc to corporations, organizations, or businesses.  The Finance category relates to ﬁnancing, loans, credit infor- mation.  The Marketing category deals with marketing, sales, and advertising strategies for companies.  Finally, the Product category describes the blog entries on speciﬁc companyproducts,suchasreviews,descriptions,andother product-related news.  Table 5 summarizes the number of blog entries in each category.
