 2.2.3. Setting of “1”.  Setting entries to –1 in S can reduce the  support of sensitive patterns; however, it may also lead to  conceal non-sensitive patt- erns.  This kind of conditions can be  solved by setting proper ent- ries to 1 in S. Consider the example  in Fig2, let minimum supp- ort be 50%, {1, 2} and {1, 3} be the  sensitive and non-sensitive pattern respectively.  Refer to the  equation on the left-hand side, {1, 2} and {1, 3} are both hidden  in D'.  However, if S 31  is set to 1, those entries that D t1  and D t3  are  both equal to 1, D' t1  will keep the same value as D t1 .  Therefore,  setting S ij  to 1 can keep the relation between item i and item j by  enhancing the strength of j.

Sanitization Matrix Setting  As discussed in section 1, to avoid F-I Attack, for each  sensitive pattern P in P H , at least one pattern belong to the  pair-subset of P should be hidden or the attacker can infer from  the subset with length 2 to the sensitive pattern recursively.  The  pair-subset is defined as follows:   Definition 1:Let F be a frequent pattern.  The pai-subpattern of  F is a sub-pattern of F with length 2.  The set which includes all  pair-subpatterns of F is called the pair-subset of F. For example: if {1, 2, 3} is a frequent pattern, then {1, 2} is a  pair-subpattern of {1, 2, 3}.  Moreover, {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}} is  the pair-subset of {1, 2, 3}.
