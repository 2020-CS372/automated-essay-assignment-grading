Fig. 5: Activity Diagram of the Supply Customer
 A use case diagram illustrates use  cases and actors for business processes, as well as  the interactions between them.  Actors are  represented as stick figures and use cases are shown  as ovals.  An activity diagram is used to describe the  workflow through a particular use case.  It consists of  action states, activity states and transitions between  them [14].  Figure 4 shows a UML high-level use  case diagram of VAM. The VAM actors are:  • Provider actor: who is interested in selling  agricultural products using the VAM system, and  supplies the VAM system with information  related to provider information, and production  forecast information.   • Customer actor: who is interested in buying  agricultural products using the VAM system, and  provides it with information related to customer  contact information (e.g. name, address,  telephone, e-mail), customer demand  information.   • Transport firm actor: who is responsible for  delivering the goods after successful matching  and negotiation process, and provides the VAM  system with transport firm information. Fig.4: A Use Case Diagram of VAM        According to the VAM system’s functionality,  use cases are the following:  • Supply customer info: it is performed by the  customer actor, and provides contact information  and demand information to the VAM system.  • Supply provider info: it is performed by the  provider actor, and provides the VAM system,  firstly with contact information and actual field  information, and next with estimated or actual  production information.   Proceedings of the 6th WSEAS Int.  Conf. on Software Engineering, Parallel and Distributed Systems, Corfu Island, Greece, February 16-19, 2007      165• Store info: it is performed by the system through  collection and storing both customers’ and  providers’ given information, in the VAM  Database (DB).  • Get marketing info: when this use case is  executed, VAM informs the providers about  regional, national and European market trends,  and customers’ preferences of products.  • Product order: It is performed by the customer  actor, who expresses the acceptance or rejection  of VAM product.   • Information brokering and matching: when this  use case is executed, VAM aggregates and  combines product information, matches the  providers’ production information and the  customers' demand information, and then makes  offers to the customers.   • Negotiate: when this use case is executed, a  negotiation takes place between the customer  actor and the transport firm actor about the terms  of the payment (e.g. method of payment) and the  physical delivery of the products.   • Transport order: after a successful matching and  negotiation process, the transport firm actor is  responsible to transport the order according to  the agreed terms.        Figure 5 shows the activity diagram of the  supply customer info use case (that corresponds  to a business process).  Initially, the customer  provides his personal data that is need to be  validated by the system.  In case of successful  login, the customer provides data for the  demanded products.  In the opposite case, the  login process starts from the beginning. Fig. 5: Activity Diagram of the Supply Customer  Info Use Case         Figure 6 shows the activity diagram of the  product order business process. In the product order  business process, the customer selects a provider  from the resulting catalogue after the provision of  the demand information, and then sends to the  system the order for checking. The system checks  the availability of the requested items.  If the  requested quantity of items item is available then,  the system informs the customer who will proceed  with the final confirmation of the order.
