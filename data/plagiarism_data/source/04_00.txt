Figure 1. Global Hand Posture Detection and
  The postures included in the visual memory may be  initialized by the human user, learned or trained from  previous tracking hand motion [San99] or they can  be generated during the recognition process.    This paper is organized as follows: Section 2  introduces an overview of system components.  Hand  gesture detection and recognition approach are  presented in Section 3 and 4.  The advantages of the  proposed system are demonstrated on experimental  evaluations from real world scenes in Section 5.   Conclusions and future work are finally described in  Section 6.   2. SYSTEM COMPONENTS  A low cost computer vision system that can be  executed in a common PC equipped with an USB  web cam is one of the main objectives of our  approach.  The system should be able to work under  different degrees of scene background complexity  and illumination conditions, which shouldn’t change  during the execution.   Figure 1 shows an overview of our hand posture  detection and recognition framework, which contains  two major modules: (i) user hand posture location;  and (ii) user hand posture recognition.  The following  processes compose the general framework:  1.  Initialization: the recognizable postures are stored  in a visual memory which is created in a start-up  step.  In order to configure this memory, different  ways are proposed.   2. Acquisition: a frame from the webcam is  captured.   3. Segmentation: each frame is processed separately  before its analysis: the image is smoothed, skin  pixels are labelled, noise is removed and small gaps  are filled.  Image edges are found, and finally, after a  blob analysis, the blob which represents the user’s  hand is segmented.
