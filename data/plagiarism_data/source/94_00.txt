Figure 1       Sequence of Events
For ease of reference,
we summarize the notation in Appendix A.
The consumer with index d derives utility ud  when
buying from the direct channel. This utility depends
on  the  delivery  lead  time  t,  which  is  set  by  the
manufacturer. The direct channel satis?es all orders
because the delivery lead time t  provides suf?cient
processing time for the manufacturer. Each consumer
also derives an expected utility Eur 
 from visiting the
retailer. This expectation is due to the uncertainty in
product availability, which depends on the retailer’s
service level . The retailer offers instant ownership,
so the consumer’s utility does not reduce because of
waiting. But the inconvenience of visiting the retailer
reduces  the  consumer’s  utility.  The  explicit  utility
functions are provided in the following section.
The  consumer  with  index  d  decides  from  which
channel to buy after comparing her utility from both
channels. The outcome of this comparison made by
each  consumer  constitutes  four  streams  of  demand
for the product (as illustrated in Figure 1). When the
consumer is willing to wait, i.e., when ud ? 0, she con-
siders buying from the direct channel as an alterna-
tive. In this case, when ud ? Eur , the consumer buys
from  the  direct  channel.  Such  consumers  constitute
the primary demand D
1
d
in the direct channel. When
ud < Eur , the consumer visits the retailer. If the prod-
uct is available at the retailer, she buys it. These con-
sumers constitute part of the retailer demand Dr . If the
consumer faces a stockout, she buys from the direct
channel.  These  consumers  constitute  the  secondary
demand D
2
d
in the direct channel.
