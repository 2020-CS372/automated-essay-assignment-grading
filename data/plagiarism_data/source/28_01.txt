 The microcontroller is interfaced with the sensors such as temperature, humidity and flame.  The ultrasonic transmitter and receiver module measures the distance of the obstacle from the robot and transmits to the server.  The robots movements is achieved with two stepper motors, which include forward, reverse, left and right turns.  The third stepper motor is used for camera rotation.  The power to drive the robot and its sensory subsystems is achieved with the aid of a 12 V battery pack.  Soft-i-robot receives and transmits signals from and to the client and server through the internet, proving that the streaming technology- based approach greatly improves the sensibility of robot tele-operation (Liu, 2005).  The parameters such as temperature, humidity, distance and flame intensity are monitored continuously by the sensors and fed to the microcontroller.  The microcontroller is programmed to transmit the information through 315 MHz radio frequency (RF) module to the personal computer (client) through a serial interface as shown in Fig.4. The personal computer in turn sends control signals to control the movement of the robot and camera position through the 434 MHz RF module. 444 Indian J.

The ultrasonic pair senses any obstacles in the path of robot and accordingly plans the path of the mobile robot.  The multimedia devices, detects and captures the image in the workspace.  Robot movement is controlled to capture a close-up image of the intruder and sent to the server.  Client receives the image through the internet and checks for danger.
