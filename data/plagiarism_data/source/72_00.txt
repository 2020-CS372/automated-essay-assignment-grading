Figure 1: Representative Attack Tree
  The attack tree approach was developed at Sparta.  The attack  tree approach is intended for penetration testing where there is  less background information about the system to be tested.  The  basic idea is a combination of the work breakdown structure  from project management and the familiar tree representation of  a logical proposition.  There are several ways to combine these  ideas into an attack tree; we will describe a typical attack tree  approach that starts with the target or goal as the root of the  tree.  Our example attack tree is taken from B. Schneier [5] and shows an attack on a physical safe. Figure 1: Representative Attack Tree  The root and most of the nodes in the tree are disjunctive nodes.  The attack is accomplished if any of the actions described by its  children are accomplished.  Disjunctive nodes represent alterna-  tive attacks.  For the example shown in Figure 1, the action Get  Combo From Owner may be accomplished either by threats,  blackmail, eavesdropping, or bribery.  The lowest interior node,  Eavesdrop, is a conjunctive node and requires all of its children  to be accomplished before it is considered accomplished.  In the  example attack on the safe, the penetrators must not only listen  for the combination, they must also trick the owner into repeat-  ing it out loud while the eavesdropping is taking place.  Con-  junctive nodes represent decomposition or refinement of a spe-  cific attack.   Install  Improperly  Bribe  Get Owner to  State Combo  The nodes of attack trees can be assigned various attributes,  such as cost or likelihood, in order to analyze a given penetra-  tion testing situation and assign priorities to certain attacks.  The  power of the tree structure for showing decomposition is par-  ticularly helpful in organizing penetration tests of undocu-  mented products or of operational systems.  Attack trees are a top-down approach to penetration testing.
