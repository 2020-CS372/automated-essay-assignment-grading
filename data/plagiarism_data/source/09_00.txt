Fig. 2- Conventional HO Algorithm for Hybrid Networks 
5- In a HN, usage of WLAN should be maximum and HO to 
WLAN should be done with high priority. Because WAN 
can provide users more bandwidth and can save power and 
cost.  Also  connecting users to  WLAN will  reduces traflic 
and interference in the mobile network. 
6-  When  traffic  in  the  WLAN  becomes  too  high  and 
overtlow occurs, HO to WLAN should be avoided. Mobile 
network  coverage  are  available  everywhere,  so  it’s  not 
necessary to connect users to WLAN when it can’t provide 
desirable service. 
7-  In  a HN,  fast users should remain connected to mobile 
network  and  prevented  from  connecting  to  WLAN  since 
WAN  is designed  for  low  velocity  users  and  has  small 
coverage (-loom). 
111. CONVENTIONAL “ D O F F   ALGORITHM FOR 
“ I D     NETWORKS 
In  this  section,  a  conventional  handoff  algorithm,  which 
based   on  RSS threshold   and   hysteresis   vaIues[S],    is 
presented Fig. 2 illustrates block diagram of the algorithm. 
First,  in  sampling intervals  RSS  values  are measured and 
their averages are computed in the averaging window. Then, 
HO  initiation mechanism indicates if  HO  process  will  be 
started  or not.  This mechanism, when the  current cell is a 
WAN,  compares  current  RSS  (RSSc)  with  a  threshold 
value (THw), if RSSc is less than THw, HO will be started. 
When the current cell is a macrocell, this mechanis will start HO  in two cases:  either current RSS  (RSSc) is less than a 
threshold  (THm) or  RSS  from  a  WLAN  is  more  than  a 
threshold (THw). If HO is started, cell selection mechanism 
selects best  available  macrocell  (“M)  and  best  available 
WLAN  (“W)  by  comparing  all  RSS values.
