Example The CongoBuy service is an example developed by the OWL-S working group to demonstrate the features of the OWLontologyforservices.

Speciﬁcation Figure 4 shows a class diagram that models the Con- goBuy service with the OWL-S stereotypes.  Speciﬁcally, it shows the speciﬁcation for an ExpressCongoBuyService that allows a user to directly purchase a book without us- ing a browsing service.  The class diagram represents the core structure of the OWL-S description as represented in the UML. Other classes, stereotypes and tagged values are also needed in order to generate the corresponding OWL-S documents.  The example contains seven classes, three of which are OWL classes speciﬁed with the  owl:Class  UML stereotype.  These classes are domain concepts that are relevant to the service being speciﬁed.  Speciﬁcally, they are elements of ontologies pertinent to the book buying and shipping domains and act as “types” for the input and output parameters of the service.  The remaining four classes specify the top level service (ExpressCongoBuy- Service) and its constituent proﬁle, model, and ground- ing (Proﬁle Congo BookBuying Service, ExpressCongoB- uyProcessModel,and CongoBuyGrounding,respectively).
