Fig. 3- HO Decision Mechanism (Current  Macrocell)
In  this  section,  a  conventional  handoff  algorithm,  which 
based   on  RSS threshold   and   hysteresis   vaIues[S],    is 
presented  Fig. 2 illustrates block diagram of the algorithm. 
First,  in  sampling intervals  RSS  values  are measured and 
their averages are computed in the averaging window. Then, 
HO  initiation mechanism indicates if  HO  process  will  be 
started  or not.  This mechanism, when the  current cell is a 
WAN,  compares  current  RSS  (RSSc)  with  a  threshold 
value (THw), if RSSc is less than THw, HO will be started. 
When the current cell is a macrocell, this mechanis will start Fig. 3- HO Decision Mechanism (Current  Macrocell) 
HO  in two cases:  either current RSS  (RSSc) is less than a 
threshold  (THm) or  RSS  from  a  WLAN  is  more  than  a 
threshold (THw). If HO is started, cell selection mechanism 
selects best  available  macrocell  (“M)  and  best  available 
WLAN  (“W)  by  comparing  all  RSS values.  The  HO 
decision mechanism is the main part of the algorithm.If the 
current cell is a manocell,  mechanism in Fig. 3 will be done 
and if the current cell is a WAN, mechanism in Fig. 4 will 
be done as follows: 
- When  the  current  cell  is  a  macrocell  (Fig.  3),  since  the 
priority is to make HO to WAN, first RSS of the suggested 
WAN  (RSSw) is checked. If RSSw exceeds the threshold 
(THw)  by  an amount  HYSw,  HO  will  be  done  to   “W, otherwise   HO   to   the   suggested   macrocell      “M”   is 
investigated. If RSSm exceeds RSSc by   an amount HYSm, 
HO is made to “M“, otherwise no HO occurs. 
-  When the  current  cell  is  a  WLAN  (Fig.  4).   h   t    the 
suggested WLAN  (‘W) is  investigated. If  RSSw  exceeds 
RSSc  by  an amount HYSw,  HO will be  done to  “W”, else 
an attempt is made for HO to the suggested macrocell “M”.
