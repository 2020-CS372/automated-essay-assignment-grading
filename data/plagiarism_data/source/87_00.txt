The basic concept of the proposed scheme is
described in the following sections. The related biological
immune system is described in Section 2, whereas Section 3
presents the developed methodology of RIN in detail. Section 4
illustrates  the  effectiveness  of  the  proposed  methodology
through some simulations. Finally, Section 5 concludes the
paper.
2.  How biological immune system works
The immune system protects living organisms from foreign
substances such as viruses, bacteria, and other parasites (called
antigens). The body identi?es invading antigens through two
inter-related  systems:  the  innate  immune  system  and  the
adaptive immune system. A major difference between these
two systems is that adaptive cells are more antigen-speci?c and
have greater memory capacity than innate cells. Both systems
depend upon the activity of white blood cells where the innate
immunity is mediated mainly by phagocytes, and the adaptive
immunity is mediated by lymphocytes as summarized in Fig. 1.
The  phagocytes  possess  the  capability  of  ingesting  and
digesting several microorganisms and antigenic particles on
contact. The adaptive immune system uses lymphocytes that
can  quickly  change  in  order  to  destroy  antigens  that  have
entered the bloodstream. Lymphocytes are responsible for the recognition  and  elimination  of  the  antigens.  They  usually
become active when there is some kind of interaction with an
antigenic stimulus leading to the activation and proliferation of
the lymphocytes. Two main types of lymphocytes, namely B-
cells and T-cells, play a remarkable role in both immunities
[34]. Both B-cell and T-cell express in their surfaces antigenic
receptors highly speci?c to a given antigenic determinant. The
former  takes  part  in  the  humoral  immunity  and  secrete
antibodies by the clonal proliferation while the latter takes part
in cell-mediated immunity.
