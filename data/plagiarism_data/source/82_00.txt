 Experimental results show that the circuit can operate at a voltage range from 1. 5V to 5V , and it can generate a pulse of100μs duration once per second.  Moreover, Fig. 4. REACH-Mote system components.  Fig. 5. REACH-Mote ﬂow chart. the current consumed in this circuit is less than 1μA, which is low enough to be driven by the energy harvester output even with very low power reception.  Thus this circuit can achieve the design requirements of an ultra low power wake-up radio trigger.  We combine the RF energy harvesting circuit and the wake- up circuit as well as the Tmote Sky to build a new wake-up radio sensor node, which we called a REACH-Mote (Range EnhAnCing energy Harvester-Mote).  Fig. 4 shows a block diagram of the REACH-Mote and the actual components.  In a wireless sensor network, the REACH-Mote works as described in Fig. 5. The REACH-Mote is put in sleep mode before the WuTx transmits the wake-up signal, i.e., the MCU on the Tmote Sky, which is an MSP430F1611 is put to LPM3 sleep mode [10] and the radio on the Tmote Sky is in the sleep mode.  When a wake-up signal is sent by the WuTx, the energy harvesting circuit outputs a DC voltage.  The wake-up circuit starts to generate the pulse once the DC voltage is higher than 1. 5V , and this will trigger the mote and put the mote’s MCU into active mode in 5ms [11].  After waking up, the data transfer is started if the mote has data to send.  The REACH- Mote goes back to the sleep mode after the data transfer is ﬁnished.  In this work ﬂow, the energy harvesting circuit is a passive component that does not consume energy from the battery.
