 This agent also makes use of the knowledge concerning the performance of the different techniques.  For example, it will make use of the knowledge detailed in the previous section that the K-means al- gorithm may experience difﬁculty in classifying “PRO” defects but it experiences no such problems in classifying “SP” defects.  4) Information Layer Agent: This layer contains an Engi- neering Assistant Agent.  This is designed to present the informa- tion to the relevant engineer.  This has been designed to present a three dimensional image of the transformer with the defect superimposed on its actual location.  Fig. 7. COMMAS architecture. summarized defect information is seen as the optimum delivery method of condition monitoring alerts.  This engineering assis- tant agent is designed to handle diagnostic information from a number of transformers for which the engineer is responsible.  The resulting multi-agent architecture from this complete de- sign process is shown in Fig. 7. E. Agent Interactions and Agent Functions Stages 5 and 6 of the design process deal with the agent in- teractions and agent functions respectively.  In order to build an extensible system, standard agent conven- tions have been used.  This means that all inter-agent communi- cations are handled using just a few types of message, examples of which are “subscribe”, “query-ref”, “inform”, and “conﬁrm”.  Of these, “subscribe” and “query-ref” allow agents to request information updates automatically and to ask for answers to spe- ciﬁc queries respectively.  The “inform” message type is used in response to both query types. “Conﬁrm” is used to indicate the success of an activity.  The MAS is supported by two utility agents.  The nameserver manages the network addresses of all the agents.
