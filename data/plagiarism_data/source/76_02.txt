Figure 3: Factors contributing to risk according  to The Open Group‘s risk taxonomy .
  To take the hysteria out of the debate, a well- founded approach towards assessing the risks  associated with Cloud Computing is needed.    A first valuable step has been taken by a report  from the European Network and Information  Security Agency (ENISA), which examines   the range of risks associated with Cloud  Computing security [1] in general.   This white paper is presented by Atos to help  organizations move towards a Cloud specific  risk assessment.  Abstract 3 Risk analysis framework for a cloud specific environmentAssessing the risk Simple but challenging answers How should the risk associated with a specific  Cloud service be assessed? The answer is  as simple as it is challenging: like any other  security-related business decision, the basis  for assessment has to be a solid quantification  of the associated business risk versus the  economic effort that it would take to mitigate   or avoid this risk (Figure 1). The economic   effort has to include opportunity cost – for  example, not realizing a potential saving or  business improvement – to reflect the   complete dimension of the decision.  How to determine risk There are many risk assessment  methodologies, but they all require similar  steps to be carried out.  Figure 2 shows the  steps used in the National Institute of Standards  in Technology (NIST) risk assessment  methodology, described in its SP800-30  NIST SP 800-30: Risk Management Guide for  Information Technology Systems [2].  The International Organization for  Standardization ISO 27005 [7] defines risk as  “the potential that a given threat will exploit  vulnerabilities of an asset or group of assets  and thereby cause harm to the organization”,  and adds that it is measured in terms of a  combination of the likelihood of an event   and its consequences.  A useful overview of  factors contributing to risk as described by   The Open Group’s risk taxonomy [4] is  presented in Figure 3. The taxonomy exhibits the same two top-level  factors of risk also mentioned by ISO 27005 [7]:  likelihood of a harmful event (here expressed as  “loss event frequency”) and its consequences  (“probable loss magnitude”).  The subfactors  of the probable loss magnitude on the right- hand side are an enumeration of the factors  influencing the ultimate cost of a harmful event.   The subfactors of the loss event frequency  shown on the left-hand side can be explained.    A loss event occurs when a threat agent   (e.g. a hacker) successfully exploits a  vulnerability.  The frequency with which   this happens depends on:   The frequency with which threat agents try  to exploit a vulnerability.  This frequency is  determined by the threat agent’s motivation  to carry out an attack action (“What can he  gain with an attack?”, “How much effort does  it take?”, “What is the risk for him?”, etc.) and  the degree of access (“contact”) that the  threat agent has to the attack target  The difference between the threat agent’s  attack capabilities and the strength of  the system to resist the attack.  The Open  Group’s risk taxonomy defines vulnerability  as: “the probability that an asset will be  unable to resist the actions of a threat agent.
