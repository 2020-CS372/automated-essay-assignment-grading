 In the appli- cation of the sorting machine, generally, the improvement of reliability is very important.  Therefore, the integrated sys- tem is much more practical and valuable.  Table 4 shows the recognition rate, the error rate and the reliability of different numerals for the integrated system.  Finally, we get the average recognition rate, the average er- ror rate and the average reliability are 95. 05%, 0.93% and 99.03%, respectively.  Experimental results demonstrate that our presented system performs very well.  It meets the re- sponse time as well as the accuracy requirements.  According to the above description, our recognition system for hand- written Bangla numerals is depicted in Fig. 8. Table 4 shows the recognition performance for different numerals.  It has been found that the highest reliability is 99. 54% obtained by Bangla numeral ‘seven’.  The mistaken recognition or rejection is due to variability of handwritings as well as bad writing.  From the experiments we note that the most confusing numeral pair is “zero” and “three” (as shown in Fig. 9(a). Second confusing pair is “one” and “nine”106 Y. Wen et al. / Pattern Recognition 40 (2007) 99–107 Fig. 9. Examples of some confused handwritten Bangla numeral pairs: (a) “0” and “3”; (b) “1” and “9”; (c) “1” and “2”. (as shown in Fig. 9(b). Third confusing pair is “one” and “two” (as shown in Fig. 9(c). Therefore, error rate or rejec- tion rare for these numerals is higher.  8. Conclusion An efﬁcient recognition system for handwritten Bangla numerals has been developed.  In the proposed system, we ﬁrst discuss two recognition algorithms based on usage of PCA, and experimental results conﬁrm the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.
