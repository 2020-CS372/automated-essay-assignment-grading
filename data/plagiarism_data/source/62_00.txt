 All rigid translation parameters (∆ x i ,∆ y i ) are used to register (resample) the corresponding raw speckle images {I i (x,y)}(i=1,...,N) in the next step.  3) Resampling Raw Speckle Images Using Cubic B-Spline Interpolator: The displacement due to disturbances need not conform to integral pixels, so the rigid translation parameters (∆ x i ,∆ y i ) always have subpixel precision.  Therefore, a resam- pling interpolation is needed to register the raw speckle images {I i (x,y)}(i=1,...,N).  In this study, the cubic B-spline interpolator [12] is used to calculate the intensity of nongrid position in a two dimensional piecewise polynomial way based on the cubic B-spline function (5) which is smooth, continuous and bounded β 3 (d)=    2/3−|d| 2 (2−|d|)/2, 0≤|d| < 1 (2−|d| 3 )/6, 1≤|d| < 2 0, 2≤|d| (5) where|d| is the distance from the interpolated point.  Although the computational cost of B-spline interpolation is not very low, it is used in this study because cubic B-spline inter- polation utilizes the non-integer parameters which is preferable over the nearest neighbor interpolation [12].  In addition, cu- bic B-spline interpolation prevents the effect of degeneration in linear interpolation [13].  After resampling, the registered raw speckle images ˆ I i (i = 1,...,N) are obtained.  The above registration procedures are summarized in Fig. 2. B. Temporal LASCA Based on Registered Speckle Images After registration as described earlier, the registered raw speckle images ˆ I i (i=1,...,N) are then analyzed by conven- tional temporal LASCA to obtain maps of blood vessels and ﬂow.  The whole procedure as described earlier is then called registered LASCA (rLASCA). 1154 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 57, NO. 5, MAY 2010 Fig. 2.

Animal Preparation The experimental protocol used in this study has been ap- proved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Johns Hop- kins Medical Institutions.  The female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat (∼ 325 g) was anesthetized with intraperitoneal (IP) injection of a mixture of 90 mg/kg of ketamine and 10 mg/kg of xy- lazine.  The rat was constrained in a stereotaxic frame (model 975, Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA).  A midline incision was made over the scalp and the tissues over the bones were cleaned with a blade.
