Fig. 1. State of art medical image classification process.
 The rest of the paper is structured as  Section 2 to Section 5.  Section 2 presents the state of art medical image classification.  Section 3 provides an  overview of data mining techniques appeared in the recent literature.  Section 4 illustrates the proposed framework  followed by conclusion in Section 5.   2. Medical image classification  Medical image classification is a supervised method which is based on probability distribution models that could  be parametric or non- parametric such as Euclidean classifier, k-nearest neighbour, minimum distance and decision  tree etc.  Although, in supervised classification one is provided with a collection of labelled (pre-classified) images  and the problem is to label newly encountered, unlabeled images.  In general, the prearranged labelled (usually  called training set) images are used to do the machine learning of the class (group) description which in turn is used  for unknown image [4].    Figure 1 shows the state of the art medical image classification process.  The classification process involves five  major steps namely image acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, classification and evaluation.  Image  acquisition step involves selection of images ranging from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance  images (MRI) to x-ray etc.  Pre-processing is a course of actions that is executed on raw data in order to achieve the  best recital for ones datasets.  It has significant impact on the performance of classification algorithm.  Data pre- processing phase comprises image cropping, filtering, gradient operations and scaling.  Feature extraction engages  feature estimation and feature selection methods.
