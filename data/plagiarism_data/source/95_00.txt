Fig. 1. Different pricing architectures with/without edge-to-edge congestion control.
 This way it is possible for the provider to update prices frequently at low time-scales, since price negotiations will be made with a software/hardware agent rather than a human.  Since the provider will not employ any congestion control mechanism for its network and try to control congestion by only pricing, we call this pricing architecture as Pricing for Congestion Control (PFCC). † By overlaying pricing on top of an underlying congestion control mechanism.  This way it is possible to enforce tight control on congestion at small time-scale, while performing pricing at time-scales large enough for human involvement.  The provider implements a conges- tion control mechanism to manage congestion in its network.  So, we call pricing architecture as Pricing over Congestion Control (POCC).

We will describe PFCC and POCC later in Section 3.  The second problem, congestion information, is also very hard to solve in a way that does not require a major upgrade at network routers.  However, in diff-serv [6], it is possible to determine congestion information via a good ingress– egress coordination.  So, this ﬂexible environment of diff- serv motivated us to develop a pricing framework on it.  In our previous work [7],wepresented asimple congestion-sensitive pricing ‘framework’, Dynamic Capacity Contracting (DCC), for a single diff-serv domain.  DCC treats each edge router as a station of a service provider or a station of coordinating set of service providers.  Users (i.e. individuals or other service providers) make short-term contracts with the stations for network service.
