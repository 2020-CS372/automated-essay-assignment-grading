 This is a combination of the  previous two technologies.  The biometric template is stored  on a hardware security module, which also performs the  matching with the live template, and hosts the biometric  scanner to acquire, select and process the live template.   II. IRIS RECOGNITION SYSTEM  The iris is the colored portion of the eye that surrounds the pupil as  shown in Fig. 1. It controls light levels inside the eye similar to the  aperture of a camera.  The round opening in the center of the iris is  called the pupil.  The iris is embedded with tiny muscles that dilate  and constrict the pupil size.  It is full of richly textured patterns that  are distinct from person to person, and in fact are distinct from left  eye to right eye of the same person.  Compared with other biometric  features such as face and fingerprint, iris patterns are highly stable  and unique as the probability for the existence of two irises that are  same has been estimated to be very low, i.e. one in 10 72  [4]. Figure 1. Image of the eye.  Generally, an iris recognition system is composed of many stages as  shown in Fig. 2. Firstly, an image of the person's eye is captured and  preprocessed.  Secondly, the image is localized to determine the iris  boundaries.  Thirdly, the iris boundary coordinates are converted to  the stretched polar coordinates to normalize the scale and  illumination of the iris in the image.  Fourthly, features representing  the iris patterns are extracted based on texture analysis.  Finally, the  person is identified by comparing his/her features with an iris feature  database. Figure 2.

It lies  between the scalera and the pupil.
