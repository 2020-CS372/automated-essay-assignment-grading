Fig.4: A Use Case Diagram of VAM        According to the VAM system’s functionality,  use cases are the following:  • Supply customer info: it is performed by the  customer actor, and provides contact information  and demand information to the VAM system.  • Supply provider info: it is performed by the  provider actor, and provides the VAM system,  firstly with contact information and actual field  information, and next with estimated or actual  production information.   Proceedings of the 6th WSEAS Int.  Conf. on Software Engineering, Parallel and Distributed Systems, Corfu Island, Greece, February 16-19, 2007      165• Store info: it is performed by the system through  collection and storing both customers’ and  providers’ given information, in the VAM  Database (DB).  • Get marketing info: when this use case is  executed, VAM informs the providers about  regional, national and European market trends,  and customers’ preferences of products.  • Product order: It is performed by the customer  actor, who expresses the acceptance or rejection  of VAM product.   • Information brokering and matching: when this  use case is executed, VAM aggregates and  combines product information, matches the  providers’ production information and the  customers' demand information, and then makes  offers to the customers.   • Negotiate: when this use case is executed, a  negotiation takes place between the customer  actor and the transport firm actor about the terms  of the payment (e.g. method of payment) and the  physical delivery of the products.   • Transport order: after a successful matching and  negotiation process, the transport firm actor is  responsible to transport the order according to  the agreed terms.        Figure 5 shows the activity diagram of the  supply customer info use case (that corresponds  to a business process).  Initially, the customer  provides his personal data that is need to be  validated by the system.  In case of successful  login, the customer provides data for the  demanded products.  In the opposite case, the  login process starts from the beginning. Fig. 5: Activity Diagram of the Supply Customer  Info Use Case         Figure 6 shows the activity diagram of the  product order business process. In the product order  business process, the customer selects a provider  from the resulting catalogue after the provision of  the demand information, and then sends to the  system the order for checking. The system checks  the availability of the requested items.  If the  requested quantity of items item is available then,  the system informs the customer who will proceed  with the final confirmation of the order.  Otherwise  (shortage of quantity) the customer has two options,  to continue by selecting another provider form the  resulting catalogue or to drop the order. Fig. 6: Activity Diagram of the Product Order Use  Case        In the following, the COSMOS environment is  used for modelling the Supply Customer Info and  Product Order business processes. These processes  are expressed as BPEL processes.  First, the manager  view of COSMOS is used for designing these  processes.  For brevity reasons, the manger view of  the product order business process is presented (Fig.  7). Second, the COSMOS developer view is used in  order to express the business processes as BPEL  processes.  In this phase, BPEL code is automatically  generated for each business process.
