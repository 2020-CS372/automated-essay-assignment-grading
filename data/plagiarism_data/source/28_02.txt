Fig.5. Functional Diagram of the Face recognition system445
 Client receives the image through the internet and checks for danger.  If the image represents a danger, then the client sends a signal to the robot to set an alarm and a warning message is generated.  The flame sensor detects fire and extinguishes within the shortest possible time.  Temperature and humidity sensors sense the environment condition for the robot and if it exceeds its normal operating conditions, then appropriate control action has to be taken.  Face recognition system When an intruder is detected, the image of the intruder is captured by the camera fixed on the soft- i-robot and transmitted over the wireless link to the client.  The recognition is performed on the client and results are displayed on the client as well as transmitted to the server(Liu, 2005).  If the person is considered dangerous warning messages are generated.  The functional diagram of the face recognition system is shown in Fig.5. Face recognition using MSNN Face recognition using MSNN(Won, 1997) is a persistent representation of morphological theories.  Hit-Miss Transform is used to extract the hit-miss distance between an eroded image and its corresponding dilated image.  The feature is then trained and compared with those of other images to determine which face is the closest match.  Face Database The image from the WS-808AS multimedia camera is found to be good in quality and not too small.  Since training and analysing too many images is a waste of time, 10 sets of available 40 images, each belonging to a different individual is chosen.  In each of these sets, there are 10 face images as shown in Table 1.  Each of them varies in orientation and expression.
