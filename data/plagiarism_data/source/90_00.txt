Figure 4 . Search Engine Flowchart 
The core of the figure plagiarism detection system is the plagiarism retrieval search engine. The 
search engines receive a user query in the form of sample figure.  It takes the sample figure and 
pre-processes it to build the query vector that will be compared with the figure-document vectors 
on  the  metadata  database.  Similarity  between  the  query  vector  and  each  figure-document  is 
calculated  using  the  cosine  similarity  measure.  The  most  similar  figures  are  retrieved  from  the 
database  using  their  figure  id,  ranked  and  presented  to  the  user. Figure  4  below  illustrates  the 
setup.3.5. User Query 
 
The user query is in the form of sample figures which can be supplied to the system individually 
or be extracted from a specified document. Low level features of the query figure are extracted 
similar to the database figures as highlighted in the Figure 5 below. Figure 5 Query Feature Extraction Steps 
 
This system is using Query-By-Example. Figure 6 shows a typical flowchart figure that can be 
supplied to the plagiarism detection system as a query.
