 Surveys show that security and privacy  are seen as blocking points for adoption of  Cloud technology, but the discussion about  them is often biased.  While it is surely right  to take a cautious approach to a technology  as revolutionary for IT operations as Cloud  Computing, it must be remembered that it also  offers great new opportunities – especially for  the small and medium business sector – and  these are often understated.   To take the hysteria out of the debate, a well- founded approach towards assessing the risks  associated with Cloud Computing is needed.    A first valuable step has been taken by a report  from the European Network and Information  Security Agency (ENISA), which examines   the range of risks associated with Cloud  Computing security [1] in general.   This white paper is presented by Atos to help  organizations move towards a Cloud specific  risk assessment.  Abstract 3 Risk analysis framework for a cloud specific environmentAssessing the risk Simple but challenging answers How should the risk associated with a specific  Cloud service be assessed? The answer is  as simple as it is challenging: like any other  security-related business decision, the basis  for assessment has to be a solid quantification  of the associated business risk versus the  economic effort that it would take to mitigate   or avoid this risk (Figure 1). The economic   effort has to include opportunity cost – for  example, not realizing a potential saving or  business improvement – to reflect the   complete dimension of the decision.  How to determine risk There are many risk assessment  methodologies, but they all require similar  steps to be carried out.  Figure 2 shows the  steps used in the National Institute of Standards  in Technology (NIST) risk assessment  methodology, described in its SP800-30  NIST SP 800-30: Risk Management Guide for  Information Technology Systems [2].  The International Organization for  Standardization ISO 27005 [7] defines risk as  “the potential that a given threat will exploit  vulnerabilities of an asset or group of assets  and thereby cause harm to the organization”,  and adds that it is measured in terms of a  combination of the likelihood of an event   and its consequences.  A useful overview of  factors contributing to risk as described by   The Open Group’s risk taxonomy [4] is  presented in Figure 3. The taxonomy exhibits the same two top-level  factors of risk also mentioned by ISO 27005 [7]:  likelihood of a harmful event (here expressed as  “loss event frequency”) and its consequences  (“probable loss magnitude”).  The subfactors  of the probable loss magnitude on the right- hand side are an enumeration of the factors  influencing the ultimate cost of a harmful event.   The subfactors of the loss event frequency  shown on the left-hand side can be explained.    A loss event occurs when a threat agent   (e.g. a hacker) successfully exploits a  vulnerability.  The frequency with which   this happens depends on:   The frequency with which threat agents try  to exploit a vulnerability. 

The subfactors of the loss event frequency  shown on the left-hand side can be explained.    A loss event occurs when a threat agent   (e.g. a hacker) successfully exploits a  vulnerability.  The frequency with which   this happens depends on:   The frequency with which threat agents try  to exploit a vulnerability.  This frequency is  determined by the threat agent’s motivation  to carry out an attack action (“What can he  gain with an attack?”, “How much effort does  it take?”, “What is the risk for him?”, etc.) and  the degree of access (“contact”) that the  threat agent has to the attack target  The difference between the threat agent’s  attack capabilities and the strength of  the system to resist the attack.  The Open  Group’s risk taxonomy defines vulnerability  as: “the probability that an asset will be  unable to resist the actions of a threat agent.

Returning to the steps of NIST’s assessment  methodology as displayed in Figure 2, we see  that Steps 2-5 deal with an assessment of loss  event frequency, Step 6 examines the probable  loss magnitude, and Step 7 combines this  information into a risk determination.  Step 8  then recommends controls that reduce risk   to an acceptable level.  For supporting a Cloud specific risk  assessment, we have to examine which  risk factors are changed by using a Cloud  Computing infrastructure rather than a  traditional infrastructure.   From a Cloud customer perspective, the  probable magnitude of future loss (right- hand side of the risk factor tree of Figure 3) is  not changed at all by Cloud Computing: the  consequences and – ultimately – cost of, for  example, a breach of confidentiality, is exactly  the same regardless of whether the data  breach occurred within a Cloud infrastructure  or a conventional IT infrastructure.   For a Cloud service provider, things look  somewhat different.  Because Cloud Computing  pools systems on the same infrastructure   that were previously separated, a loss event  may entail a considerably larger impact.    This fact is easily grasped and incorporated   into a risk assessment: no conceptual work   for adapting impact analysis to Cloud  Computing seems necessary. 

Mapping of a Cloud specific vulnerability to  mitigating controls should consist of a list of  relevant controls and a brief description of   why each control is relevant.   Revisiting the “Injection Vulnerabilities”  described in the previous section, a mapping   to NIST controls could look like this:  When programming web applications/services,  sound security engineering principles must be  used (SA-08) and security must be embedded  into the development lifecycle (SA-03); tests  should be performed during development   (SA-11) and possibly complemented with a  security assessment (CA-02).   Technical means to prevent injection  vulnerabilities are information input validation  (SI-10) and flow control on user-input (AC- 04); depending on the way flow control is  implemented, tagging with security attributes  (AC-16) of user input may be necessary.

Which vulnerabilities are mitigated  by such advice and how relevant are they  really? Are there relevant vulnerabilities that  have been overlooked? The very same  questions arise when carrying out a   Cloud specific risk assessment for a   given Cloud service.    Carrying out the steps described above,  Atos has identified around 40 Cloud specific  vulnerabilities (nine of which are control  challenges), and mapped these vulnerabilities  to mitigating controls out of NIST’s  recommended security controls for federal  information systems [3].  Furthermore, each  vulnerability has been positioned in relevant  layer(s) and supporting function(s) of the  Cloud reference architecture.  Thus, a cloud- specific risk assessment following, e.g. the steps  outlined in Figure 2 is supported as follows: System characterization By positioning relevant system components  in the Cloud reference architecture, a  standardized abstract view on a system   under evaluation can be achieved.   Vulnerability identification Because all identified Cloud specific  vulnerabilities have also been positioned in the  Cloud reference architecture, it is immediately  clear, which vulnerabilities are relevant for the  system under consideration (and which system  components may be affected).  Thus, the  usually time-consuming process of vulnerability  identification can be carried out very efficiently.  Control analysis and control  recommendations The mapping of vulnerabilities into controls  provides a sound basis for control analysis   and control recommendations.     Atos has created this framework as the basis  of a well-founded approach to assessing and  treating Cloud related risk.  Comprehensive  assessments based on this research are  currently carried out in the Atos development  process to ensure transparency and an  adequate level of protection for our customers.  Cloud Computing is in constant development.
