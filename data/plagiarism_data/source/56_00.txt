 A small region  within an image is assumed to have approximately uniform  intensity in Chow and Kaneko [33] and threshold depends on  the local intensity.  In an alternative approach, local statistical  parameters in the neighborhood of a pixel, are examined to  find the local threshold.   The statistical measure of the  neighborhood to be considered may depend on the type of  image.  In simplest measures, it could be mean of the local  intensity distribution; or the median value; or the median / the  mean of the minimum and maximum values, etc.  In the  present approach the threshold is taken as the average value of  mean and median of the local intensity distribution of the  fuzzy edge map.  The neighborhood size of a pixel need to be  sufficient to enclose enough of the foreground and background  pixels, but at the same time not too large to lose the advantage  of the local statistic.  When the variance of the local region is  too low the local threshold is replaced with the global  threshold to avoid threshold become too low in case of the  smooth region.  Fig. 5 represents the block diagram of the  proposed approach.   VI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS  The performance of the algorithm is compared against some  well-established edge detection methods, namely Canny,  Sobel, Prewitt, Roberts, LoG, and some of the latest edge  detection methods described in BFED [20], FEDBF [21],  PSODE [23], ACED [25], EDUG [26], GEDT [27],  IVFE  [13], Canny-gs [15], WFIE [14], M-Sobel [6].  The BFED and  FEDBF are based on bacterial foraging algorithm, PSODE is  based on particle swarm optimization, ACED is based on ant  colony optimization, EDUG and GEDT are based on theory of  gravitation.  We have also compared our work with some state  of art edge detectors based on the fuzzy theory [13-15] and  multiscale edge detector [6].  The human judgment is supposed  to be the best measure in case of edge detection, but at the  same time it can be subjective.  Moreover, human visual  system (HVS) has its own limitations; therefore, the  quantitative measures are also engaged to judge the  performance of the proposed approach.  The color image edge  detection may be performed by applying the proposed  algorithm to each component, i.e. red, green, and blue.
