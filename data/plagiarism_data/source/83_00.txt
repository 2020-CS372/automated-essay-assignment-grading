 Section V describes and compares FPGA implementations of AES realizing different algorithmic options and incorporating the EDAC function.  Section VI concludes the paper.  II. ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD– ALGORITHM AND MODES OF OPERATION The AES is a symmetric key algorithm, in which both the sender and the receiver use a single key for encryption and decryption.  AES defines the data block length to 128 bits, and the key lengths to 128, 192, or 256 bits [11].  It is an iterative algorithm and each iteration is called a round.  The total number of rounds, N r , is 10, 12, or 14 when the key length is 128, 192, or 256 bits, respectively.  Each round in AES, except the final round, consists of four transformations: SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey.  The final round does not have the MixColumns transformation as shown in Fig. 1. The decryption flow is simply the reverse of the encryption flow and each operation is the inverse of the corresponding one in the encryption process.  The round transformation of AES and its steps operate on some intermediate results, called state.  The state can be visualized as a rectangular matrix with four rows.  The number of columns in the state is denoted by Nb and is equal to the block length in bits divided by 32.  For a 128 bit data block (16 bytes) the value of Nb is 4, hence the state is treated as a 4£4 matrix and each element in the matrix represents a byte.  For the sake of simplicity, in the rest of the paper, both the data block and the key lengths are considered as 128 bit long.  However all the discussions and the results hold true for 192 bit and 256 bit keys as well.
